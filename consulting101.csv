The organization is comprised of a headquarters and 120 local offices across the globe. Historically, headquarters has provided local offices with standardized curriculum and marketing materials, but each local office has operated independently with its own board of directors, operating processes and data management systems. In recent years, EI headquarters has been working to change this, particularly in regards to data management.
In order to better fundraise with corporate-level donors, EI headquarters wants to be able to see and report real time information on the organization’s volunteers and fundraising information.

This mandate was met with great resistance from many EI local offices and since the beginning of the project, headquarters has been concerned about the success and reputation of the project.
Using an internal team, EI piloted implementing the CRM system at six local offices. Each of these offices had different legacy data management systems and business process transformations that needed to be taken into consideration. After a year of piloting the system, the project has suffered considerable challenges. EI headquarters is receiving calls from local office leadership complaining that the system is cumbersome and employees are tremendously overworked trying to adjust to it. In addition, the implementation team is struggling because each local office data varies greatly, local office leadership is not engaging their staff to adapt to the new system, and there is considerable evidence that employees are not actually using the system.
Overall, the local office pilots have not been successful and word is spreading throughout the entire organization that the CRM adoption is a colossal failure. EI has brought in your consulting firm to advise them on next steps. In particular, the implementation team would like help determining:
• Who are the stakeholders that need to be most considered in order to achieve success?
• What risks does EI face in this project?
• What approach should EI take to ensure that this project does not fail?
• How should it implement the CRM software for the other 114 locations?

organizational behavior | strategy,Deloitte Consulting,"aerospace, defense | engineering","Case Interview Question #01146: During the cold war, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) shipbuilding (SB) industry was based on programs. Each program was different (e.g. destroyers, submarines, patrol ships) and had its own organization, own technology, own engineers and own manufacturing facilities.
In the mid-90s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia was facing a strong recession, and decided to make public its shipbuilding industry. However, some of the States with manufacturing facilities (see Exhibit 1 below), were concerned about losing these facilities, and therefore, increasing the unemployment in the region (each State with facilities had an average of 50,000 direct employees and 150,000 indirect employees). To keep everyone happy, the federal government decided to give over 60% of the company to States ownership (3-8% for each State depending on the number of facilities and employees) and the remaining stake to public offering.
To make it more interesting for private investors, the company was restructured in 3 main divisions: naval, submarines and advanced technology (AT).
After 15 years, the company has doubled its employees and has become one of the biggest players in the shipbuilding industry. Revenues are $85B for naval, $10B for submarines and $12B for advanced technology. A new CEO has been appointed to manage the whole company. She is concerned about the effectiveness of the company, specially in the military segment. Her concern is based on three factors:
1. 80% of naval revenues comes from commercial products (e.g. light boats, ferries)
2. Within the naval program, military ships are just adapted from commercial ships (e.g. goods transport, tankers). See Exhibit 2 below.
3. The advanced industry division, has four programs (Electronic Defense, IT, Cyber Security and Missile Boats), where missile boats are less related to the other three programs.
The new CEO is thinking of creating a new division, called Military, to manage all ships with military purposes. She is hiring your consulting firm to evaluate if this is a good decision.

Coffee Inc. is a large multinational woman’s clothing retailer with worldwide revenues of over $3 Billion in calendar year (CY) 2011. They sell sports, formal and casual apparel. The company as a whole has been performing strongly and has emerged out of the financial crisis with strong sales growth and many investment opportunities. Despite the company’s strong performance overall, its American operation has an under-performing brand that they have put up for review and have also closed some of the brand’s associated stores.
The American operation has two major umbrella brands: a formal wear brand bearing the same name as the company, “Coffee”, and a casual wear brand named “Tea”. The brands are sold through the following channels: 
• Coffee branded retail stores: $200M in annual revenues
• Tea branded retail stores: $20M in annual revenues
• Coffee branded outlet stores: $150M in annual revenues
• Wholesale sales to major retail chains (e.g., Macy’s): $600M in annual revenues
The Tea brand has historically been neglected because management has focused its resources on the core business – the Coffee brand. Nonetheless, the Tea brand has consistently put up a profit with minimal management attention and capital re-investment. Essentially, the management of Coffee Inc. wishes to understand whether they are better served by divesting the Tea brand and refocusing their attention on their core Coffee brand business or holding the Tea business and simply “milking the cash cow”.
Deloitte Consulting has been approached by the management of Coffee Inc. to assess whether Coffee should hold or sell the Tea brand. Specifically, there are 5 questions for you to address:
1. Using the “terms of the sale” from the data sheet, find the associated revenues for 2012 that the buyer would receive from buying Tea and compare that to the associated revenue that Coffee could maintain by not selling Tea.
2. How would you value the sale scenario and hold scenario? Present your findings.
3. If Coffee Inc. decides to hold the Tea brand, how long will it take for the cash flow from Tea to equal the amount of money that Coffee would have received through selling Tea? Note: Please use $50M as the sales price.
4. Based on your analysis, what would you recommend to Coffee?
5. Are there any other relevant issues that may affect the valuation or the divestment decision?

The client focuses primarily on the higher education student health insurance market, selling medical insurance, prescription drug insurance and dental insurance to students at large universities. The client is the market leader, both in terms of customers (~500,000) and revenue (~$500M). The overall market for higher-education student health insurance is estimated at 2.5 Million potential customers and $2.2 Billion in potential revenue.
This market requires a unique, two-staged sales model. The “first sale” is often made to the on-campus student health center to gain access to the student population. The “second sale” is to the students, who are the ultimate consumers and purchasers of the insurance products. In certain segments of the market, a broker may also act as an intermediary to the school.
The client’s operating margins have declined significantly in the face of aggressive competition and shrinking higher education budgets. Additionally, Health Care Reform presents a potential risk for future growth and profitability – notably, students age 26 and under can remain on their parents’ health insurance (versus having to buy student health insurance) and health insurers will be required to spend 80% of all revenue on medical expenses.

Plant Vogtle is one of the largest nuclear stations in the United States and one of the largest power plants of any fuel type nationwide in terms of annual energy output.
When producing electricity, it is difficult to find a cost effective way to deal with spent nuclear fuel. Currently there are two ways to deal with spent nuclear fuel: Closed Cycle and Open Cycle. How the fuel is used is identical for each disposal process; the only difference is how each is handled after being fully used.
With Closed Cycle, you open the reactor, remove the spent fuel and ship it to an off-site temporary storage facility for 20 years. After the fuel cools down for 20 years you then ship the fuel to a permanent storage facility.
With Open Cycle, you open the reactor, remove the spent fuel, and ship it to an off-site reprocessing facility. The spent fuel is broken down into three components; plutonium, uranium and “really bad stuff”. Plutonium can be stored for free. The uranium can be processed a second time and converted into Reprocessed Uranium Fuel, and sold. The “really bad stuff” needs to be stored identically as the spent fuel in the open cycle.

Over the past three years the firm has been working to overcome challenges identified in their practice through an organization-wide change initiative. There are two key components of this change initiative — (1) a brand new technology called LCS and (2) a suite of tools, resources, and methodologies to ensure streamlined processes called RDTC Project Management. RDTC Project Management (RDTC PM) is the driving force behind the new RDTC Methodology to performing audits while LCS is simply the new software that will allow auditors to successfully execute this new methodology. This is also the first time in the history of the organization that project management has been emphasized and used to evaluate performance of staff.
RDTC is entering the third year of this change initiative and is at a critical inflection point with both LCS and RDTC PM. LCS has rolled out to all of the small and medium project teams but is now set to deploy to all large accounts. These large accounts bring in the most revenue for RDTC, have the largest teams, require the most staff hours, and have most senior audit partners leading them.
Deployment of RDTC PM has had several challenges. One of the most important aspects has been the role creation and hiring of 50 new, full-time project managers to enhance RDTC’s project management capabilities; thereby ensuring a consistent methodology for performing audits. RDTC forecasted that the 50 new project managers would be assigned to the 70 largest project teams by this year. So far only 20 have been hired and assigned to 30 project teams teams. In addition, the existing project managers have met resistance from the account teams who are not accustomed to having project management oversight.

• How do we prioritize the challenges that their change initiative is facing?
• What should they consider as LCS prepares to deploy to large engagements?
• How can we attract new project managers and focus on ensuring success of the ones?

Symptoms may include upper abdominal fullness, heartburn, nausea, belching, or upper abdominal pain. Traditional therapies used for dyspepsia include lifestyle modification, antacids, H2-receptor antagonists (H2-RAs), prokinetic agents, and antiflatulents. It has been noted that one of the most frustrating aspects of treating functional dyspepsia is that these traditional agents have been shown to have little or no efficacy.
Biogen’s CEO believes their new drug for dyspepsia is revolutionary. Take the pill and symptoms disappear within the hour. The CEO wants your help to fix the price. What would you recommend?

Its business consists of two types of aircraft: (1) jet engine, 80 to 100-seat aircraft and (2) propeller, 20 to 30-seat aircraft.
In fiscal year 2013, Bombardier delivered 100 jet engine aircraft and 150 propeller. This represented a unit volume increase year-over-year of 10% and 5%, respectively, and revenues of USD $730 million and $225 million, respectively.

Over the past several years, Bombardier has experienced eroding profitability in its jet engine aircraft business.

The client Mead Johnson sells their product nationwide in the US, and are in the middle of the pack in terms of market share. They are currently trying to boost their market share in US while maintaining profitability.
There is a government welfare program called WIC (Women, Infants, Children) that allows individuals living below the poverty level to receive vouchers for infant formula for their children. Unlike most welfare programs, this one is subsidized by the actual producers of infant formula. On a state-by-state basis, infant formula producers bid for the right to be the sole supplier of infant formula to welfare recipients in that state. In addition to paying the government for the WIC contract, the client also provides rebates to retailers for WIC sales. As a result, income received from WIC sales is substantially less than that received from normal formula sales. In fact, sales to mothers that remain in the WIC program for more than 12 months result in a net loss.

In about six months Novartis will receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to launch a new anti-depressant drug. Despite this apparent good news from the FDA, Novartis USA is not elated.

(1) launch the drug alone,
(2) co-market with a partner, or
(3) sell, license or swap the drug.
The concerns over market potential center on whether the drug can gain adequate competitive advantage in a market segment having two dominant, patent-protected competitors and nearly 100 generic competitors. Additionally, a higher technology antidepressant, which appears to offer therapeutic advantages, was recently introduced by a major competitor Pfizer.
Gaining the professional endorsement of psychiatrists is crucial to success in this therapeutic category since they write approximately half of the prescriptions for antidepressants. However, Novartis USA has no experience marketing drugs to this physician group. Consequently, it would have to hire a sales force and/or enter into a co-marketing agreement to gain access to psychiatrists through someone else’s force. The client would be able to leverage its existing sales force to reach the other half of the prescribers (Internal Medicine Specialist and Family and General Practitioners).

• Electricity can be supplied to a wholesaler or to consumers directly.

Mr. Jeff Weiner feels that there are some redundancies in his company. So he wants to find out the following:
• Where are the people?
• What are they doing?
• What are their skill sets?
To help with this, he got help from KPMG Advisory to make a spreadsheet survey that will contain all this information for all the company’s employees. He also got KPMG Advisory to write an instruction sheet on how to fill up the spreadsheet survey. There are 9 layers in LinkedIn Corporation:
Layer 1: CEO
Layer 2: VPs
Layers 3-8: Other Managers
Layer 9: Employees
There are 10 VPs and 1,800 people in all in the organization. Assume it takes 30 minutes to read the instruction sheet and 3 minutes to fill information about each person in the spreadsheet survey.
There are three options for the CEO to conduct the redundancy survey:
A. Send the survey and instructions to the 10 VPs who will complete the survey and send it back to the CEO.
B. There are 360 people with people management roles in the organization. These 360 people will fill up the survey for all their direct reports.
C. Choose 60 managers who will fill up the information for 30 people each.

reduce costs,OC&C Strategy Consultants,industrial equipment | manufacturing,"Case Interview Question #00957: Our client Karl Gilmore, long time CEO and the largest shareholder of Midwest Machinery Inc. (Midwest) is worried. Overall Midwest’s competitiveness has been slipping as it has been losing business more often to competitors due to price. Through benchmarking studies and some strategy consulting work, Karl knows that his cost structure is not competitive. As a result, he has been pushing his team over the last couple of months to find ways to reduce costs.
Midwest Machinery makes a wide variety of machines designed specifically for the medium to heavy industrial sector that are used in everything from factories, farms, tractors and industrial buildings. Revenue is USD $3 Billion, with net profit margins around 12% (Note: net profit is $360M).
The CEO had demanded that management look for new ways to find cheaper ways  to produce machines. This research has pushed management to comb the globe for alternative suppliers in far away places such as Colombia, Shanghai and India.
Karl has also been very demanding with regard to the processes that support all of the operations. In particular he wants to ensure basic activities that do not involve intellectual capital are performed at the lowest cost possible. In particular, he does not want to overpay for labor when it is not necessary. He respects Midwest’s traditions and the strong sense of community it has with the local town, but he knows that profitability must come first for him and his shareholders.
Pressing Issue:
Karl’s Six Sigma team has come up with a proposal to move the manufacturing process for the XL292 machine, a critical machine for many of Midwest’s end products, to India. Also, these results may affect Karl’s decision on whether to outsource over $300M worth of costs. But before Karl looks at the financial data he wants to have a clear understanding of the pros and cons of outsourcing.
Case Questions:
1. Develop a structure for thinking through the pros and cons of outsourcing this manufacturing process to India. Your structure can only cover 5 topics that may or may not concern the business. You can only ask two questions before creating your structure. Explain this model and what you would advise Karl to consider as he reviews the data.
2. After explaining your model, ask for the financial data and calculate the profitability of staying local vs. going abroad to India.
3. Using the data, return to your model and explain how it has affected your thinking. You may ask three more questions at this point before concluding with your advice to Karl.

If the ICs refer a friend to sell Dolphin products and does so, that sale still generates 20% commission for the new IC, but also an additional, smaller commission for the person who originally referred him. This process continues and you get an increasingly smaller cut of sales from members that were referred by those you referred, etc. This “down-stream” sums up to approximately 10% commission total.
Dolphin has been losing revenues lately. Two years ago they had $35M in revenue, one year ago they had $28M, and this year they have $20M. This year they are operating at zero profitability – breakeven.
Although the cost of the acquisition is not significant due to their relative sizes, Mattel wants to have a company that can pay its own way. Your consulting firm has been hired to advise Mattel on this acquisition. Specifically, you have been asked to address two questions:
(1) What do both parties have to gain from this acquisition?

Effectively, the transporter is a near-instantaneous teleportation device. However, you should make sure you don’t assume exactly what the transporter, as invented, can or can’t do. (In this case, non-Trekkies may have an advantage!)

Possible Answer:
Think through the information you do have. Having spent a weekend in New York once, you may remember that there are five boroughs. You may have also noticed, however, that the vast majority of taxicabs are in Manhattan, with a smaller number at LaGuardia and JFK airports.
Considering Manhattan, then…conveniently, most of Manhattan has a grid-like street structure. The avenues are the north-south streets, which tend to be quite wide, typically 4-5 lanes. The numbered streets, running east-west, are more narrow and often only have 1-2 lanes of traffic. During rush hour, when most taxis are presumably out, roughly how many taxis are on a given block of an avenue or a street?
On the avenues, there are probably 1 taxi per lane, for a total of 4-5 taxis per block of avenue. You need to log in to access the rest of the page. Please Log in or Register now.Subscriptions start at only $7/month. Or, solve 6 sample cases for free!

Hilton Worldwide has 13 brands across different market segments including Conrad Hotels & Resorts, Canopy by Hilton, Curio – A Collection by Hilton, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, DoubleTree by Hilton, Embassy Suites Hotels, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton Inn, Homewood Suites by Hilton, Home2 Suites by Hilton, Hilton Grand Vacations and Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts. As of January 2016, Hilton Worldwide’s portfolio includes 4,610 hotels with more than 750,000 rooms.
Hilton Worldwide has just completed the development and testing of a POS (point of sale) application for its worldwide hotel chain. The client Hilton Worldwide has retained Deloitte Consulting to develop an implementation strategy. What process would you go through in developing your implementation strategy, and what assumptions would you make in preparing your recommendation?
Additional Information:
The point of sale (POS) or point of purchase (POP) is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed. It is the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a service. At the point of sale, the merchant would prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be a cash register printout) or otherwise calculate the amount owed by the customer and provide options for the customer to make payment. After receiving payment, the merchant will also normally issue a receipt for the transaction.
The client Hilton Worldwide is primarily considering a decision between a phased deployment across various international regions, or a big bang approach that would simultaneously update all the sites concurrently.
The client Hilton Worldwide recently used a big bang strategy to deploy a customer service application in all its hotels. This release did not go well due to poor training and lack of adequate testing.
The Hilton Worldwide hotel chain has recently made some acquisitions that will require some system integration. These systems have some time-consuming manual operations they would like improved when integrated.
The new POS systems contain functionality that must be implemented in the North American Region within six months. Failure to do so would expose the client to possible regulatory litigation.
Hilton Worldwide Hotels are divided into regions as well as by service tiers:
• Service Tier 1 – Luxury 4 and 5 star hotels catering to top executives and other premium clientele.
• Service Tier 2 – 3 and 4 star hotels catering to business travelers, and vacationers with moderate to high spending preferences.
• Service Tier 3 – 2 and 3 star hotels designed to meet the needs of the budget market.
The Service Tier 1 hotels help to define the overall brand for the company, so problems with customer service due to a system upgrade would be very damaging.
The Service Tier 2 hotels are the largest source of revenue for the client.

The WHO is a specialized agency of the United Nations that is concerned with international public health. It was established in April 1948, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. Since its creation, the WHO has played a leading role in the eradication of smallpox. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, Ebola, malaria and tuberculosis.
Each year the World Health Organization receives USD $2.5 billion in grants to reduce the incidence of disease in developing nations. Every year, they allocate 20% of this budget to fighting malaria. 80% of their malaria budget goes toward R&D and 20% to onsite implementation.
A few facts about malaria: Approximately 50% of the world’s countries are considered “at risk”, which means malaria is common among the population. The biggest problem is in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this region, the disease has a 40% incidence rate among children under the age of 5. However, children who live past the age of 5 usually acquire immunity to the disease by this stage of their life.
It is early 2016, and the WHO malaria team has just found out that for this year, and this year only, their budget will be increased by 20%. These additional funds could be invested into the purchase and distribution of bed nets, or they could be used to further R&D on a malaria vaccine with a robust pipeline.

Our client is the health minister of Luxembourg. Luxembourg is small and on the upper end of the GDP spectrum for countries of its size. The country’s health system is completely free to its citizens, and is funded by taxpayer money.

There are a few private systems for the richest citizens, but they are so small in comparison to the public system that they won’t be considered at all in our study.

You have been assigned the task of helping the client figure out where they can cut costs. What would you do?
Possible Answer:
Interviewer: First of all, what do you think are the various cost elements of a biscuit manufacturing company?
Candidate: The various cost elements in the firm will be manufacturing, supply chain and distribution costs and other administrative costs. Manufacturing can be again divided into procurement cost, raw materials cost, labor wages.
Interviewer: OK, let’s start with the supply chain.
Candidate: I need some background information regarding the company such as how many manufacturing plants it has?
Interviewer: The client company has 15 third party manufacturing plants and 3 plants of its own. The supply chain is common for all.
Candidate: I will split the supply chain again into inward and outward logistics. There will be various raw materials such as corn, flour, oil, sugar and butter for the manufacturing of biscuits. Can I get the cost of each of these components?
Interviewer: They’re not relevant. Focus on outbound supply chain.
Candidate: What is the structure of the distribution channel?
Interviewer: Basically, there is inventory from factory to warehouse and then to distributors.
Candidate: I will look at transportation costs and inventory costs in these cases. Can I have the split up of costs for transportation like the transportation cost per unit?
Interviewer: Transportation cost is €0.25 per mile per thousand pounds of biscuit and the distance between factories to the warehouse to 300 miles.
Candidate: Does the transportation company charge the same amount for all similar transports across the industry?
Interviewer: The unit cost of transportation for all the competitors is the same.
Candidate: What is the distance from the factory to warehouse for the competitors?
Interviewer: We do not have that information, but in general the average distance traveled by trucks for transportation in the industry is 200 miles.
Candidate: In that case our client company’s trucks are traveling a greater distance compared to our competitors. Can I get the location of the factories and warehouses?
Interviewer: The factories are located in remote rural locations. This was actually the reason for high costs for the client. The client was spending heavily on transportation. I think that concludes our discussion in the case. Do you have any questions for me?

(NYSE: XOM) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation headquartered in Irving, Texas. It was formed in 1999 by the merger of Exxon (formerly Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) and Mobil (formerly the Standard Oil Company of New York). The company is one of the “Big Five” oil companies (Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell, and ConocoPhillips Company) in the U.S.
As an integrated oil and gas company, Exxon Mobil engages in the exploration, production, refinement and distribution of oil and gas, and controls the entire supply chain from oil wells to gas stations. Recently, researchers and scientists in Exxon Mobil have discovered a new automobile fuel that will increase car mileage by 30%. It will also cost 10% more to produce the fuel. The fuel is similar to the old fuel in every other way.
What should Exxon Mobil do with the new fuel?
Additional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions
There are 5 major players in the industry, including our client: Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell, and ConocoPhillips Company. They all have equal market share.
The interviewer asked me to guesstimate what the demand would be like. One approach – the population of the U.S is about 300M, with 3 people to a household, that makes it 100M households. With one car to a household, it makes it 100M cars. At 20 gallons per week, the weekly demand is about 2,000M, or 2 Billion gallons/week.
No special environment concerns or advantages from the new fuel.
Under no circumstances can the client Exxon Mobil capture more than 10% of the market due to capacity constraint.
Margins on old automobile fuel are 10%.
Complication if the interview is going well:
What if there were two distinct markets? – The private sector and the Government? Assume that the government buys 10% of the total market capacity and buys equally from all 5 players. Should you sell only to the government? What effect would it have on prices?
Possible Solution:
Note to the interviewer or case giver: The case per se does not have a conclusive solution; it is intended to test the ability of the interviewee to integrate and look at different issues with the same case. Some of the specific issues that I got to discus in my interview are listed below.
The basic framework I laid out at the beginning was to say that I would go through the various issues of
• Demand issues
• Capacity issues
• Internal issues – whether we could produce it on same machinery, same channel, etc.
• Analyze competition
• Environmental issues
• Alternate uses of fuel
Some key issues that were covered in the interview:
Pricing: how should they price the fuel? (There is no specific information on prices of existing fuels) but relative to the old fuel, what should be the price of the new fuel?
What would be the margins from the new fuel? Assume that the margins on the old fuel are 10%. Then, the margins would be about 24% on the new fuel. This can be arrived at through the following steps:
• Old fuel price: $1
• Cost of old fuel: $0.90
• Gross Margin: 10%
• New fuel price: $1.30 (since it gives 30% more mileage)
• Cost of new fuel: $0.99 (since it is 10% more expensive to produce)
• Gross Margin: $1.30 – $0.99 = $0.31, ~24%
What kind of elasticity would auto fuel have?
How do you think competition would retaliate to your suggested price of the new fuel?
They could retaliate by lowering prices on the old fuel. Then the question would be how much lower? I used break even theory and said they would drop price until they were only covering variable costs.
Alternately, with the capacity constraint that the client has, competition need not bother lowering prices. Hence, instead of losing margins on their bread and butter, competition could avoid a price war. With higher gross margins, the only player that could win a price war would be the client.
Any price movement (either priced higher or priced lower) caused due to the new fuel?
How would the competition price the old fuel if the new fuel were priced at just higher than the old fuel?
What if there were two distinct markets? – The private sector and the Government? Assume that the government buys 10% of the total market capacity and buys equally from all players. Should you sell only to the government? What effect would it have on prices?
A good answer here would be that – it would be very sensible to sell to the government alone since this would negate the possibility of any price war.

Established in 2000 by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, GSK was the world’s sixth largest pharmaceutical company as of 2015,  after Pfizer, Novartis, Merck, Hoffmann-La Roche and Sanofi.
GSK has a prescription migraine medicine, IMITREX, which belongs to a class of medicines called triptans. IMITREX was the first medicine in this class (introduced to the U.S. market in 1995) and had patent protection in the U.S. until 2015. It remains the market leader despite the emergence of 5 direct competitors in the triptan class. Triptans compete with other nonspecific prescription pain relievers. IMITREX also competes with over the counter (OTC) headache products. The volume of OTC use is at least 10 fold higher than the prescription medicines for migraine. An IMITREX prescription for 10 tablets costs approximately $150 at the retail pharmacy level (1 Tablet per migraine headache), although many patients have health insurance and pay a co-pay of $20 to $30 per prescription. OTC headache medicines cost approximately $5 for a bottle of 30 tablets (2 tablets per headache).
Your consulting firm has been hired by GSK to assess the revenue potential of IMITREX, as it faces the imminent patent expiration. Specifically, you’re tasked with addressing the following four questions:
• How would you structure your analysis and determine if this was the right direction for the IMITREX brand?
• If you were going to switch from prescription to OTC, when do you think it should occur in the lifecycle of the IMITREX product?
• Would you need any additional information?
• Would any competitive issues change your decision or affect your analysis?

It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north. Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world with a population of 52 million as of 2014. The Capital is Dodoma and the largest city is  Dar es Salaam. The neighboring Kenya has a population of approximately 45 million people as of July 2014. Kenya’s Capital and largest city is Nairobi.
Your client is “South Beer”, a major beer producer in Tanzania. South Beer used to be the only supplier of beer in Tanzania until a few years ago when “North Beer” of Kenya entered the Tanzanian market. In retaliation South Beer entered the Kenyan market. What do you expect happened to the revenues of South Beer in the Tanzanian market?
Possible Solution:
First, ask the interviewee what could have happened. — I would expect beer prices to drop from a monopoly position based price, to a market price. North Beer entered the Tanzanian market with low prices to build market share.
What else could have happened? South Beer’s cost increases:
• South Beer’s COGS may have increased due to smaller volumes of beer being sold in Tanzania.
• Marketing costs may have increased to stop North Beer’s entry.
• Labor costs may have increased due to second potential employer being available.
In fact, after a couple of years both the Kenyan and Tanzanian parts of the beer business were making a loss. What should South Beer do?
Additional Information: to be provided after relevant questions
• North Beer is also not making money.
• North Beer has 90% market share in Kenya and South Beer has 80% market share in Tanzania.
• We think the market share of South beer in Tanzania is worth $80M and the market share of North Beer in Kenya is worth $180M.
After obtaining data on market share, I further calculated:
• Market size of Kenya = $180M/90% = $200M
• Market size of Tanzania = $80M/80% = $100M
• The market share of South Beer in Kenya = $200M * 10% = $20M
• The market share of North Beer in Tanzania = $100M * 20% = 20M
I suggested South Beer to buy out North Beer’s share in Tanzania. However, when evaluating how much you would pay for the business you also need to consider:
• Is the profitability of market share related to market share %, or have we captured a high profitability niche market?
• Cost cutting opportunities
• Cross selling opportunities
The interviewer then asked: How would you go about estimating future revenues streams, ignore volumes but focus on how would you get good pricing data?
• Inflation -> get data from governmental sources
• Analyze/compare previous inflation data to beer prices
• Predict inflation impact on beer prices
After the interview the interviewer provided the following information: eventually North Beer and South Beer bought each other out in the other’s territories and they set about a joint venture in a third country to leverage their expertise and to get used to working together.

Your client Pennzoil has historically made significant profits, but recently it has come under threat and we have been hired to address three concerns.
1. Over a few previous years consumers believed that they needed to change their oil every 10,000 miles. They have started to realize that in fact they can get away with only changing their oil every 20,000 – 30,000 miles.
2. Historically in the U.S., 80% of the oil change market is in DIY (Do it yourself) and 20% in DIBSE (Do it by someone else). This has started to shift in favor of DIBSE. Our client Pennzoil has a 2nd position in the DIY market but only a 10th position in the DIBSE market.
3. The CEO of Pennzoil has promised his shareholders a 200% increase in profits over the next 5 years.

(NYSE: CTL) is large telecommunications service provider headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana, United States. It provides communications and data services to residential, business, governmental and wholesale customers in 36 states. The company operates as a local exchange carrier and Internet service provider in U.S. markets and is the third-largest telecommunications company in the United States in terms of lines served.
In the past the telecom industry has enjoyed a monopoly as various regional telecom companies established monopolies under government protection. Recently the U.S. government has passed a new law that allows competitors to enter other regional areas where there is already an incumbent present. The competitor (new entrant) can lease incumbents infrastructure and target incumbent’s customers. The incumbent will have to charge the price set by the government. The client CenturyLink has seen some cannibalization in their regions so they set up a new division to penetrate other regions. However, for the last 2 years that new venture/division has been unprofitable. The CEO wants your judgment before he makes a decision to shut the new division down. What recommendation would you give to the CEO of CenturyLink?
Additional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions
• Number of current customers signed up by the new venture/division: 1 million.
• The average price per customer per month charged by the new division is $38.60. It is 10% less than the competition.
Cost structure
• Selling, General & Administrative Expense (SG&A) is $5.10 – half of which is Fixed Cost and other half is Variable Cost.
• The client believes that they can reduce SG&A by 10% at most without affecting quality of business.
• Government has set a price of $36.90 that the client has to pay to the competitor per customer per month.
Possible Solution:
Candidate: First, I would like to understand the revenue structure of the client. Can you tell me how many customers does the new division have?
Interviewer: 1 Million.
Candidate: I think that client has done really well by gaining 1MM new customers in just 2 years in a new territory. Seems like the client has good service offerings.
Interviewer: The client offers a very good quality service.
Candidate: What about prices? Is there also a standard price for each customer or is there some price discrimination?
Interviewer: You are right, there is some price discrimination but I have the average price per customer per month of $38.60. This price is 10% less than the incumbent player.
Candidate: Why is client charging 10% less than the incumbent?
Interviewer: What do you think?
Candidate: I think this is an aggressive pricing policy to penetrate a new region.
Interviewer: Sounds good.
Candidate: Let me go to the cost drivers now. Could you tell me the Fixed Cost and Variable Cost drivers? Obviously the government set price will be a big factor.
Interviewer: SG&A is $5.10 – half of which is Fixed Cost and other half is Variable Cost. Also, the government has set a price of $36.90 that client has to pay to the competitor per customer per month.
Candidate: OK, it looks like the client is not even making money at an operating level. I.e. ignoring Fixed Cost the client is still losing money per customer. Obviously, the $36.90 that client pays to incumbent cannot be changed because it is set by the government policy. I’d like to look at SG&A and understand whether the client is operating at industry average or not.
Interviewer: Good point. The client believes that they can reduce SG%A by 10% at most without affecting quality of business.
Candidate: OK, reduction of 10% on $5.10 of SG&A does not even let the client break even. You mentioned that there is some price discrimination and the price you gave me was an average price. Could you tell me more about customer segments?
Interviewer: Yes, there are non-business consumers and business consumers.
Candidate: Probably the price to business customers is higher as compared with non-business, because of peak load pricing and inelastic nature of business consumers.
Interviewer: Yes, you are right.
Candidate: Could you tell me what percentage of client customers are business vs. non business?
Interviewer: 90% non business and 10% business.
Candidate: So the client is heavily relying on a very price sensitive segment of the market and thus pressured to reduce margins. I would recommend that the client should not close the non-business part of the new division but try to switch from targeting non-business to targeting business consumers and create an opportunity to charge higher prices.
Interviewer: Very good! This is what BCG actually recommended the client. Thank you.

Based in Mundelein, Illinois, United States, Medline Industries is a leading manufacturer and distributor of health care supplies such as medical gloves. Their customers include hospitals, surgery centers, physicians’ offices, extended care facilities, and dialysis centers.
The client Medline Industries Inc. sells its medical glove products directly to hospitals and medical centers in two segments. The first product segment is “exam gloves”, which are single gloves that come in Kleenex boxes. They are disposable and made of latex. The second segment is surgeon gloves, which are used in operating rooms. They come in pairs and they must be of high quality and sterile.
The client has come to you because their medical gloves profit and revenue growth has been slower than that of the competition. They want to know how they can fix this, and in general, how they can improve shareholder value. How would you go about this case?
Additional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions 
1. Client’s growth rate: 2% per year
2. Product Segments
3. Exam glove segment:
• 15-20 competitors
• Client is market leader with 30% market share
• Company A has 20% market share
• Company B has 10% market share
• 15 smaller players, most of them new entrants, control the rest of the market.
• Price has been falling somewhat, margins are being squeezed 7-8% growth.
Important: growth comes from new customer segments (police department, fire department, etc. who have a need for such gloves given increased fears of HIV and other diseases, new safety standards).
4. Surgical glove segment:
• 3 major players
• Client is market leader with 50% market share
• Company B has 30% market share (same company B as above)
• Company C has 20% market share (they do not sell exam gloves)
• 2% growth
• stable prices
• Both company B and C are growing faster than us.
Important (do not give this piece of information away unless specifically asked): not all surgeons have the same needs when it comes to gloves. For example, some need thicker gloves (e.g. bone surgeons) than what is currently available, so they use 3-4 pairs of gloves, one in the other.
5. Client’s Cost Structure:
Variable costs
• Raw materials is 60% of variable cost. This is mostly the cost of latex, which is a commodity. The client has maximized any purchasing economies of scale due to its size.
• Labor is 20% of variable cost.
• Overhead is 20%.
Fixed costs
• We have a plant in Malaysia, where we produce the gloves, similarly to competitors.
6. Manufacturing issues:
• Surgical gloves are more difficult to produce because they need two molds instead of one, the fingertips need to be bent, sterilization is a bigger issue and thickness is higher.
7. Sales issues:
• We sell to all major hospitals in the US and we have reasonably far-reaching operations abroad.
• We have good relationships with the hospitals we sell to.
• Hospitals have need for many different accessories, not just gloves: gowns, tablecloths, masks, needles, scissors, etc.
Possible Solution:
First, state how (by what measure) you will maximize shareholder value and list the factors impacting that measure that you will have to look at.
Important (many people miss this): Prioritize which product segment to look at first by calculating the current profit made in the exam glove segment ($4.5 M) and the surgical glove segment ($25 M):
• Surgical glove segment: 200 M * $0.50 * 50% * 50% = $25M
• Exam glove segment: 1 B * $0.05 * 30% * 30% = $4.5M
Identify the key issues that need to be addressed in each segment (with a greater focus on the surgical glove segment):
• Surgical glove segment: we are not leveraging our dominant position and good relationships in this market. Growth is lagging behind our competitors.
• Exam glove segment: our margins are being squeezed and we are not serving the new growth segment that is outside hospitals.
Recommendations:
Surgical glove segment:
• Innovate with existing products. E.g. do a survey of surgeons and assess their needs. Introduce product modifications, e.g. a thicker gloves for bone surgeons.
• Cross-sell new products (e.g. masks, tablecloths, gowns) with high profit potential by forming alliance with or acquiring manufacturers of these items. Talk about trade-offs of such a diversification strategy (management time, organizational issues, cost-accounting with SKU proliferation).
Exam glove segment:
• Sell to the new growth segment of police and fire departments through established distribution channels.
• Consider out-sourcing manufacturing of exam gloves to increase management attention on profit-making business and perhaps even cut manufacturing costs.

As one of the largest managed health care companies in the U.S., Aetna sells traditional and consumer directed health care insurance plans and related services, such as medical, pharmaceutical, dental, behavioral health, long-term care, and disability plans.
Over the past two years, your client Aetna and some other healthcare insurance companies have started offering “private fee-for-service” (PFFS) to their respective Medicare patients.

As I mentioned, your client Aetna launched their PFFS program two years ago. They expect the product to gain in popularity among their members. Other healthcare insurance companies also expect PFFS to grow. However, many insurance companies who have started offering PFFS are concerned because they do not currently have the additional administrative support needed in their billing departments to process all the PFFS claims.

Under the artistic direction of legendary jazz musician Wynton Marsalis, JALC is committed to providing top quality Jazz performance and education to the world.
Founded in 1987, JALC has been in existence for more than 25 years. Until 2003, JALC had been housed in the Lincoln Center Complex along side the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Ballet, and Julliard School for the Performing Arts. In 2004, JALC moved to the Time Warner Center – a high end commercial and corporate complex located on Columbus Circle. The move provided JALC with new, state-of-theart facilities, greater capacity (from 3000 to 4000 seats), and performance venues with expansive views of Central Park.
JALC receives three primary revenue streams: subscriptions, single ticket sales, and donations. JALC, like all major performing arts organizations, relies on patron subscriptions to smooth demand and provide up-front cash flows. The general rule of thumb is that 50% of tickets should be sold to subscribers and 50% to single ticket holders.
The move to Time Warner Center has been a mixed blessing for JALC. In response to significantly higher fixed costs (rent, utilities, etc.), JALC had to increase ticket prices an average of 75%. However the move has also generated significant press attention and general buzz across New York City. Although attendance has been up since the move, subscription rates have declined in each of the first two years in the new venue.

Question #2: How would you figure out the current value of the coffin business? Provide the following additional information if the candidate asks for it clearly and directly.
Market Size – If the candidate asks for the size of the market, first make him/her brainstorm about different ways to determine market size. A good candidate should come up with at least 4 different ways, such as:
Question #3: Now make the candidate calculate the market size, giving them the following data:
Possible Answer:
(4 million) x (1/75) * (75%) = 40,000 coffins purchased per year.
Note that the candidate needs to quickly realize that every year, 1/75th of the total population will turn 76 and therefore (on average) will die.
Question #4: Now make the candidate calculate the value of Moldovan Coffins’ business, giving them the following data:
Price – Coffins are priced at $5,000 for a hand-made high-end coffin.
Costs – Material accounts for 10% of the direct cost, while labor accounts for the other 90%. COGS is $4,800 per coffin. Fixed costs for the business are $700,000 per year. Assume all assets are fully depreciated and ignore taxes.
Competition – The client Moldovan Coffins has a 10% market share and a relative market share of about 1 (if asked, you may explain that relative market share is the ratio of the company’s market share to that of its nearest competitor.)
Market Trends, Regulation, etc. – If asked about any exogenous factors, simply tell the candidate to assume that the market is expected to continue as it currently is.
Possible Answer:
The candidate needs to calculate the value of the business now. This is a pure mathematical exercise.
Assuming a discount rate of 10% (candidate can assume anything reasonable here as long as they are consistent later), a perpetuity with cash flows of $100,000 per year has a present value of $100,000 / 0.1 = $1 Million. So the current business is worth $1M whether they keep it or sell it.
Question #5: So now what is the value of the company if it were shut down and the assets were sold? Additional Information to give if asked:
Assets – Since the firm has been building coffins by hand, the fixed assets are essentially only the land and improvements. These are owned outright by the company.
When the candidate asks for the value of the land, have them brainstorm ways that they might determine this. They should come up with at least 3 good ways, such as:
Give the candidate the following information and have them calculate the value of the property:
Possible Answer:
Using the “rule of 72″, a 6% growth rate will double the investment every 72/6 = 12 years. Since the property was held for 48 years, the current value will be $100K * (2 x 2 x 2 x 2) = $1.6M.
Since the assets ($1.6M) are higher than the value of the discounted cash flows ($1M), then it would make more sense to liquidate the business and sell the assets.
Question #6: What would the value of the company be if the owner invests in the new technology? Provide the following information if asked:
Investment – Investing in the new technology will cost the firm $1M.
Cost Savings – Material costs remain the same, but labor costs are reduced by 50%.
Proprietary Nature of Technology – The new coffin-making technology is being offered for sale by a machine tool company, who holds the patent. They are not offering exclusivity to any customers (i.e. they will sell to Moldovan Coffin’s competitors if possible).
Competitive Threat – It is not known whether the competitors have acquired or are planning to acquire this new coffin-making technology.
Customer Preferences – While the machine-made coffins are not “hand made”, the quality perceived by the customer is the same or better. It is believed that the customer will be indifferent between the quality and appearance of a hand-made and a machine-made coffin.
Brand Impact – The candidate may argue that a machine-made coffin might negatively impact Moldovan Coffin’s brand. If so, ask them how they would test this (e.g. consumer research), but tell them to assume that it would have negligible impact.
Possible Answer:
Since Moldovan Coffins has no proprietary control over the technology, it is likely that competitors will also acquire it, resulting in an overall lowering of the industry cost structure. If this is the case, price will also fall as competition cuts price in an attempt to gain share. If we assume that gross margins remain the same, since the industry competitive structure has not changed we can calculate the new margin contribution as follows:
So the introduction of the new technology to the market might be expected to reduce industry profits, making this business completely unprofitable.
Candidates could argue other scenarios, by assuming that the industry would be able to maintain higher margins than we have assumed here, so the answer may be different. They should recognize, however, that the introduction of this non-proprietary technology will significantly reduce industry pricing in the absence of some other form of price support (such as branding, collusion between players, etc.)
7. Conclusion
A star candidate will see that his/her time is nearly up and will present a recommendation for the client without prompting. If the interview is within 3 minutes of the end, ask: “The owner just called and said he has an offer to buy his business. He needs to know whether he should take it right now.”
Possible Answer:
Given the credible threat of the industry becoming unprofitable due to the introduction of this new technology, the owner should look to sell the company as soon as possible. Taking into account the assets of the firm and the present value of the expected cash flows of the business itself, he should attempt to liquidate the business and to sell the assets for around $1.6M.
If the owner is unable to sell the business now, he can continue to operate the business as a cash cow, but should not invest in the business above what is necessary to keep it operating at its present level. He should expect the business to become less profitable as the industry moves to mechanization, and should eventually look to sell the assets of the company and close the firm.
Comments:
This case was given by McKinsey in one of their first-round interviews and is a typical “command and control” style McKinsey case. In this style of case, the interviewer allows the candidate to drive the case initially to explore possible routes to a solution. However, once the candidate has laid out a plan, the interviewer takes control and asks the candidate to solve a few specific problems before coming to the final conclusion.
When giving this case, allow for some initial planning and brainstorming by the candidate, but then firmly take control of each of the “modules” described in the case. Try to move the candidate along through each of them, since in the actual interview only those candidates that complete all of the sections will be considered to have done well. This case tests mental horsepower and the ability to move to conclusions quickly.

Currently ExxonMobil is the biggest downstream gas operator in the United States, i.e., it operates the largest number of retail gas stations. The downstream oil sector is a term commonly used to refer to the selling and distribution of natural gas and petrol products derived from crude oil, such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel oil, etc.

Two business school classmates of yours laud their entrepreneurship intentions and mock your interest in entering the management consulting industry. They decide that despite recent trends, what is needed is a video rental store closer to the University of Pennsylvania campus. They try to convince you to join their venture, but in your infinite wisdom you join a prominent strategy consulting firm in Philadelphia.
Well, their first two years meet unprecedented success. They buy matching Porsches and a townhouse in Society Hill. Needless to say, each time you meet up for social occasions, they share with you (mostly with tongue in cheek) their success and a sort of “I told you so” attitude. You handle their jabs well, as you feel you have had a terrific experience at your consulting firm.
The story, however, changes in about 12 months. Despite two and a half years of dramatic profit and revenue growth, their video store’s profits have dramatically fallen. They call you (with a fair amount of egg on their face) and say “we don’t know what happened and our mortgage and car payments are getting tougher to meet.

Therefore, be sure to engage the interviewer as you approach the case.
The interviewer was expecting the interviewee to first provide a structure/framework, which would look at the big picture and then start hypothesizing. A strong candidate would:
Possible Solution:
Interviewer: So, how would you go about this case?
Candidate: (Summarize the case and work on a framework) In this case it is important to look at the competition (specifically, understand the different cost structure of the 3 producers A, B, C), estimate the market demand and discuss the international trade environment. We should also discuss the specifics of a metal commercialization.
Interviewer: OK. Where should we start?
Candidate: Clearly, our client is running on full capacity, but its competitors appear to have some idle capacity. Furthermore, I note from the data provided that the competitors’ cost structures allow them to sell in the international market while our client does not currently export any of the products. Our client would experience zero margin if it was to export since the international price is given at $450 which is equal to our client’s cost of production. Nevertheless, the local price is considerably higher than the international price, so the producers would rather sell as much as possible in the local market. Given this information, I would hypothesize that there is not enough demand in the local market.
Competitors would prefer to sell in the local market ($600/ton) instead of export ($450/ton)
Competitors are running with idle capacity, but we know that demand exceeds current supply
Interviewer: That is correct. But what about the international market?
Candidate: This is a good point. You did mention that there is a strong demand for this steel product worldwide. Now we have to find out why the competitors are not selling their full capacity. We can think of many possible reasons, such as geographical distance, transaction costs, transportation costs, export taxes, etc.
Interviewer: They all make sense, but as we see competitors are able to export some metal, right?
Candidate: Competitors might have operations abroad so it makes easier to export to their international facilities. Or they might produce part of their capacity close to harbors. Considering that the international price is much lower than the local one, I would expect some barriers for international trade.
Interviewer: That is correct, Brazil does have some taxes for foreign products and producers struggle with transaction costs. Let’s look at the cost structure. Why do you think there is a difference in costs?
Candidate: I could consider geographic location, technology, economies of scale, supply chain synergies, etc.
Interviewer: You mentioned some important elements. Our client has only one location and the competitors have multiple plants, each in the countryside. Our client was the first player in this market, having built its facilities 10 years earlier than its competitors. The industry has realized that a plant must have a minimum of 1,000,000 ton capacity in order to be efficient.
Candidate: But our client is still making a lot of money, right?
Interviewer: Yes, enough to convince the CEO to invest in a new production facility. This would be a $400 million investment in year 0 for a capacity of 1,000,000 tons with a cost of $420/ton. How would you evaluate this investment if this new production would be traded in the international market? Would you recommend this investment?
Candidate: Basically the margin will be $30/ton ($450 – $420) * 1,000,000 equal to $30 million per year. By using a 10% discount rate this investment will generate only $30 million / 10% = $300 million in total. The $400 million investment would not be worth it.
Interviewer: That is true. So, are you going to advise the CEO of 3M not to make the investment?
Candidate: I would advise him against it unless he is willing to engage in a price war.
Interviewer: OK. What would be the minimum price he could go to turn this investment profitable?
Candidate: We should be cautious because a lower price would impact the current profitability.
The current margin is ($600 – $450) * 600,000 = $90 million.
For instance, if we drop the price to $513/ton,
With the 10% discount the minimum profit required from the new plant would be $400 million * 10% = $40 million. Therefore, the minimum price would be $513/ton.
Interviewer: But if you drop the price to $513/ton, what would the competitors’ reaction be? Would they also increase production? Remember, they have idle capacity and you don’t.
Candidate: That is correct, but the competitor has a lot more to lose with a price reduction. In our client’s case we found out that it would lose money as the margin of the current production drops. However, the client only sells 600,000 tons right now while the competitors sell 4,800,000 tons combined. They would probably reduce their production to avoid a higher price reduction.
Interviewer: Really? So you are recommending our client to invest $800 million in a 2,000,000 tons capacity plant?
Candidate: I haven’t done the math but I guess this would be too risky. I would recommend our client to invest the $400 million and see how the market reacts.
Interviewer: That is a fair recommendation; after all they will be playing a game with no real expected result. Great, can you summarize your findings for the client?
The candidate should now summarize the findings from this discussion for the client, highlighting the approach and key recommendations.

Possible Answer:
Interviewer: So, how would you go about analyzing this case?
Candidate: (Summarize the case and work on a framework) This case requires us to estimate the potential market size of route Guangzhou-Perth, the growth opportunity, the competition as well as our client’s resources. Also, any legal or governmental issue should be discussed.
Interviewer: OK. How would you estimate the market size (demand) for the Guangzhou-Perth route? What do you need to know? I have been working with this client for a long time and might have the needed information.
Candidate: Although we could estimate the size of the market, it might be more reasonable to look at the current information the client company has about the indirect route. I would believe many passengers already fly from Perth to Guangzhou by connecting flights in Sydney, right?
Interviewer: Correct.
Candidate: So I would like to find out the number of flights per day, the number of passengers per flight and the percent of these passengers that actually have Perth as the origin or destination.
Interviewer: Very well thought. It is a smart decision to start more conservative. Our client China Southern Airlines currently flies twice a day from Guangzhou to Sydney and back. It currently operates Airbus 320 in this route, with 80% load factor. 15% of the passengers have Perth as the origin or destination. I can also tell you some aircraft limitations:
Candidate: This gives us 165 * 80% = 132 passengers per flight or 132 * 2 = 264 passengers per day (one way), of which 15% or 40 have Perth as the origin (and final destination). We should have in mind that if the client offers the new Guangzhou-Perth direct flight, it will reduce the load factor of the Guangzhou-Sydney route from 80% to 68%.
Aside from our own cannibalization, I would expect that by offering this new route our client China Southern Airlines will be able to take customers from its competitors, right? Actually, does the client have any competition on its current routes?
Interviewer: There is only one competitor flying from Guangzhou to Sydney, but this competitor has a code-share agreement with a domestic airline that flies from Sydney to Perth. From Guangzhou to Sydney the competitor flies an A330 (240 seats) daily with the same 80% load factor. Also, 15% of its passengers have Perth as the origin or final destination.
Candidate: This gives us an additional 240 * 80% * 15% = 30 passengers/day. Before we conclude that our client will be able to steal these customers from the competition, let’s analyze the pricing points. Do you have any information of prices?
Interviewer: Both our client and the competitor charge $600 per one way from Guangzhou to Sydney or Guangzhou to Perth.
Candidate: It is interesting to see that the passenger pays the same fare to fly from Guangzhou to Sydney (4,800 miles) and from Guangzhou to Perth (4,800 + 2,350 = 7,150 miles). So basically we have the same price and potentially a faster trip. Unless we find any competitive advantage other than travel time, we could assume our client is able to steal all the Guangzhou-Perth customers from the competitor.
I would also imagine that by entering into this route our client would have first-mover advantage and the competitor would not enter this route if they didn’t think that it could steal share from our client.
Interviewer: This makes sense. Basically you have estimated a conservative demand. What else would you analyze?
Candidate: We know the potential demand; although there is an expected growth in the industry let’s see whether this route would be currently profitable. What do we know about the cost structure?
Interviewer: The total fixed cost of operating A319 and A320 are $41,000 per flight and $62,000 per flight respectively. There are some variable costs, but they are marginal.
Candidate: Basically for route Guangzhou-Sydney the client must use an A320, but A319 is an option for route Guangzhou-Perth. Let’s analyze the daily revenue, cost, and profit for each route:
Revenues from Guangzhou to Sydney: (165 * 80% * 85%) * $600 = $67,320
Cost for Guangzhou to Sydney: $62,000 (A320)
Profit: $67,320 – $62,000 = $5,320
Profit margin: $5,320 / $67,320 ~= 8%
Revenues from Guangzhou to Perth: (40 + 30) * $600 = $42,000
Cost for Guangzhou to Perth: $41,000 (A319)
Profit: $42,000 – $41,000 = $1,000
Profit margin” $1,000 / $42,000 ~= 2.4%
I am assuming the client could use the A320 for the main Guangzhou to Sydney route and A319 for the new Guangzhou to Perth route. As we can see, the former route will remain profitable (8%) and the new route will give a 2.4% margin.
Interviewer: So, what is your conclusion?
Candidate: Taking into consideration that a 2.4% margin is not a very bad number for the airline industry and that our assumption does not take into consideration an additional demand generated by the new faster route from Guangzhou to Perth, the client should at least launch a trial of this new route. The former route, from Guangzhou to Sydney, will remain profitable.
Interviwer: Very good. Thank you.

This is a typical Bain style case. The interviewee should feel free to bring in their understanding of the airline industry as they see fit.

The interviewer was expecting the interviewee to structure a framework, which would look at the big picture that any MBAs should have in mind about the airline industry. A strong candidate would have to arrive into final numbers as well as in a final conclusion.

(NYSE: VRX, TSX: VRX) is a Canadian pharmaceutical company with activities spanning the drug discovery pipeline from target identification through clinical trials and commercialization. Headquartered in Laval, Quebec, the company’s focus is on neurology, dermatology and infectious disease with several drugs in late stage clinical trials.
Valeant’s first drug has just been approved by Health Canada, the equivalent to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is a new treatment for asthma. The client Valeant Pharmaceuticals has hired FTI Consulting to help them assess what is the right price for this new treatment and they will also need FTI Consulting’s help with completing an application to the Canadian government for price approval. The second step is necessary because, as you may know, Canada’s government subsidizes healthcare costs and we will discuss this in greater detail later in the case.

Kearney,retail,"Case Interview Question #00625: Trader Joe’s is a privately held chain of specialty grocery stores headquartered in Monrovia, California. As of February 2012, Trader Joe’s had a total of more than 360 stores. Approximately half of its stores are in California, with the heaviest concentration in Southern California, but the company also has store locations in 30 other states and Washington, D.C. The Trader Joe’ chain has offices in both Monrovia, California and Boston, Massachusetts.
Describing itself as “your neighborhood grocery store” or “your unique grocery store”, Trader Joe’s stores sell mostly private label staple foods, organic foods, and specialty products. Unlike typical grocery stores, which may carry 50,000 items (or SKUs), Trader Joe’s stocks about 4,000 items, 80% of which bear one of its own brand names.
You are a consultant working with A.T. Kearney. The other day you were on the golf course with billionaire businessman Mr. Theo Albrecht, who owns the Trader Joe’s chain. Mr. Albrecht posed a question that you found very interesting. His question was, why should he continue to centralize his company’s sourcing rather than split it to procurement and distribution at the individual store level. How would you best assess the question?
Possible Solution:
This is a pure conceptual “supply chain optimization” case in which the candidate will have to come up with a number of reasons to go one way or the other. Be creative in the way you think about it, the case is open ended, but look for guidance from the interviewer if you start to go too far.

improve profitability,McKinsey & Company,small business | information technology (IT),"Case Interview Question #00621: Ghana, officially the Republic of Ghana, is a country in West Africa with a population of about 24 million (as of 2010). The capital and largest city is Accra, with an estimated urban population of 2.3 million as of 2012. Ghana is ranked as a Lower–Middle Income Economy by the World Bank. In 2011, 27% of Ghana’s population were living on less than $1.25 per day.
Ghana’s capital city of Accra boasts about 500 internet cafes. Our client is Busy Internet, the largest internet cafe in Accra and in Ghana. Recently, Busy Internet is experiencing a decline in profit. The Managing Director of Busy Internet, Ms. Estelle Akofio-Sowah, has hired your consulting firm McKinsey to asses the problems. In addition to identifying the cause of declining profits, you also need to give recommendations and assist them through the implementation process. How would you to about this case?
Additional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)
Besides the regular product/service provided by an internet cafe (like emails, web surfing, video games), Busy Internet also offers a range of other related services:
Suggested Approach:
The purpose of this case is to asses the candidates’ analytical skills and his/her abilities of gathering information through appropriate questions. A good understanding of the Ghanaian business climate is important but not a must. A good structure to answering the case is necessary. The interviewee should suggest a possible framework and a solution but he/she should have a clue about the major problems of implementing changes in a non-traditional business environment like Ghana.
Gathering information in Ghana is extremely difficult, and managers tend to flood consultants with information. Therefore a good structure, the ability to prioritize and navigate through useless or cloudy/ambiguous information is important. For these reasons, the interviewer can give upfront useless information and hide the important ones.
Since Ghana best practices are still to be polished, it is important that the interviewee display a certain degree of flexibility and adaptability while asking questions. The use of inflated and difficult terms should also be avoided.
Possible Answer:
Interviewer: So how would you analyze this case?
Candidate: It really looks like an interesting and complex case. May I have a second to structure my analysis?
Interviewer: Sure.
Candidate: OK, so these are the basic steps of my structure.
First, I want to know more about the products. It looks like Busy Internet has a very diverse product/service mix. So I want to know more about the service Busy Internet is selling to its customers, they can have different profit margins.
Next, since Profit = Revenues – Costs, I want to analyze these 2 elements separately.
Finally, I want to analyze the market’s trend for each of these products/service.
Interviewer: Sounds great, let’s start with the product mix. Busy Internet sells a big variety of different services to its clients, but we can group the major sources of revenues in 3 different products:
Candidate: OK, let’s analyze these 3 divisions separately.
Interviewer: All right, what’s next?
Candidate: What do we know about the costs for these 3 divisions? Have they increased lately?
Interviewer: Ghana experiences black outs, and in order to maintain the service Busy Internet must use a very expensive power generator. Apart from that, the 3 product lines have not experienced any increase in cost.
Candidate: What do we know about the revenues for these 3 divisions?
Interviewer: The copy center is experiencing a decrease in revenues; the same can be said for the cyber cafe while the ISP is slowly growing.
Candidate: That is interesting. Do we know any information about the global markets for all these products? Are these markets growing in Ghana? Are they fragmented?
Interviewer: OK, here is some more information:
Candidate: Thank you. What do we know about the competitors?
Interviewer: Good question. There are new entrants in the Cyber Cafe market, a new internet cafe called Mega Internet is stealing customers from Busy Internet Cafe. Competitors in the ISP market are mostly minor players with the addition of Ghana Telecom, the government sponsored Internet Service Provider.
Candidate: What is our value proposition to our customers? Similarly, how is the competition targeting our customers?
Interviewer: Busy Internet customers are elite customers, prices at Busy Internet are very expensive (the highest in Accra), and cusomters expect high quality. Not many competitors can target the same segment of customers. We can say that there is only one big competitor that can offer similar quality compared to Busy Internet cafe.
Candidate: The scenario now looks clearer. Our revenues for the cyber cafe are declining for a decrease in volume and not in price. Why is Busy Internet loosing clients in the cyber cafe?
Interviewer: Good questions. How would you look for that?
Candidate: My idea would be to ask the customers. Also, we can conduct quality survey, supervise customer behaviors, and assess employees’ performances.
Interviewer: It looks like Busy’s customers are gradually moving to another cafe Mega Internet since customer care and service quality is better. Also PCs in the internet cafe at Busy are getting old and many of them are not working properly, decreasing actual capacity and customer loyalty.
Candidate: I have another question, I am still not sure why our revenues in the copy center are decreasing while the market and demand for copy center is growing. Is that connected with the decrease in traffic of the internet cafe?
Interviewer: It could be. What other possibilities would you investigate?
Candidate: Well, there are many possible issues
Interviewer: Good points, they all make sense. Ms. Estelle Akofio-Sowah, the managing director of Busy Internet, has just reached us to ask for the executive summary of your analysis. What should we tell her?
Candidate: It looks like the decrease in profit is due primarily to decrease in revenues and in volumes.
Busy Internet must concentrate its investment in the copy center, since it is a growing market. The cyber cafe is a declining business in a shrinking market, but Busy Internet should keep the cyber cafe and use it to cross sell other products like ISP and copy center services. Busy should invest heavily in customer care, employee training, performance incentives, technology improvement in order to perk up services and increase cyber cafe customers’ loyalty.
ISP is growing. Busy Internet should leverage its customer base, client portfolio and its economy of scale to anticipate and satisfy customer expectations.
Optional Bonus Questions on implementation
Interviewer: Ms. Estelle Akofio-Sowah looks impressed of your analysis. But she also looks skeptical on some of the points you have just mentioned. She thinks that there are no major problems on the technology side as well as the customer care. Investments on these areas are expensive and additional funds from shareholders have to be motivated.
These questions are like “bonus questions” and are meant to be asked only to these candidates that developed a very good understanding of the economic/problem solving side of the case and are ready to give suggestions also on the implementation/leadership side.
Rather than asking about previous leadership experiences in which the candidates demonstrated motivation, persuasion and other interpersonal skills, this case offers the opportunity to “bring the interviewee to Ghana” for 20 minutes and assess his/her economic and interpersonal skills on a real African situation. The last part of the case can be easily changed on a role-play interview so to give a more realistic taste to the case discussion.

increase sales/revenue | market entry,Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH),household goods & consumer products | cosmetics & beauty products,"Case Interview Question #00606: Booz Allen Hamilton was recently retained to work with the newly appointed Vice President of International Business at a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) company. The CPG company, Neutrogena, is headquartered in Los Angeles, California and has 95% of its sales in the US.
Neutrogena has 3 product lines: skin care, hair care and cosmetics. The majority of its sales and the focus of this case are on its sun care products, like sunscreen or sun tan lotion. Sunscreen (a.k.a. sunblock, sunburn cream or block out) is a lotion, spray, gel or other topical product that absorbs or reflects some of the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the skin exposed to sunlight and thus helps protect against sunburn. The company’s total revenues from sun care products was about $1 billion for last year.
Neutrogena was recently acquired by a large multinational medical devices, pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods manufacturer Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). As it has a very broad international presence selling healthcare related consumer products, the new parent company Johnson & Johnson wants to double its international sales in the sun care product division by 2013. Currently Neutrogena’s international sales, only 5% of total annual sales, are seemingly random, with no real vision or strategy behind it. Distribution is in diverse markets.
We were hired by the newly appointed VP of International Business at Neutrogena to help our client in determining how best to approach this growth prospect.

With its head office in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, its operations center is in Fort Mill, South Carolina, USA. The company designs, manufactures, markets and distributes a wide range of  business, commercial printing, publication as well as technical and specialty papers.
Right now, Domtar Corporation is the second largest paper manufacturer in the US market, after International Paper Company (NYSE: IP). The management of Domtar believe that if they increase their production capacity by 50,000 tons a year, they can become the number 1 player in the market (their goal) in both revenue and volume. The client would like you to advise them whether or not they should increase capacity by 50,000 tons/year. What would you recommend?
Note:
This “increasing capacity” case is about testing how well the candidate can engage the interviewer in intellectual discussion of key facts/strategic issues. The case assumes that the candidate has already made the second round and that the partner doing the interview is more interested in getting to know how the candidate thinks, builds relationships, and communicates than standard first round cases.

new business | investment,Bain & Company,railroads & trains | transportation | government & public sector,"Case Interview Question #00603: Our client is The Ministry of Railways (MOR) of China. The ministry is responsible for the development of the rail network and rail infrastructure in mainland China, passenger services, and regulation of the rail industry. The ministry is also in charge of the operations of China Railways which  manages 16 railway bureaus and 2 railway group companies in China.
Recently, the Chinese MOR is considering investing a large ammount of money to build a high speed railway between Beijing and Shanghai, the two largest cities and the two most important economic zones in China. You have been hired by the ministry to advise them on this major project. Should they go ahead with the investment? What issues must be considered before making a “go” or “no-go” decision?
Additional Information: (to be given to candidate if asked)
1. Comparison of regular railway and high-speed railway
2. Population
3. Capital requirement of the project
Possible Answer:
To make a “go” or “no-go” decision, essentially one has to evaluate the projected profitability of the project. The candidate will have to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of the proposed high-speed railway project. The “Profits = Revenues – Costs” framework seems the right way to start with.
1. Market Sizing: estimate the passenger volume of the high-speed railway
Ways to determine this:
a. Population of these two cities
The candidate should have a general sense of the population of Beijing and Shanghai. But for simplicity, let’s say 20 million people in each city. But not everyone can afford the high-speed train service, since we will probably charge a premium over regular railroad services.
b. Market size of competitive services
So, who is the high-speed train’s real competition?
However, with travel time between city and airports, security check, waiting at the airport and everything else, we estimate that our high-speed train will be 1 to 1.5 hour faster than airplanes. Also, if someone is willing to spend 12 hours on a train, they are unlikely to be our target customer!
Therefore, the real competition comes from air travel.
2. Pricing: how much should we charge for high-speed train service?
a. Look at our cost to see what margins we need:
b. Look at people’s willingness to pay:
One way to determine customer’s willingness to pay is through customer survey.
Based on our initial study, the number 1 criterion of our target customers (business travelers) is speed, followed by flexibility of the service schedule, i.e. we need to be servicing as frequently as the flights. We also found that we cannot charge more than $500 as corporate clients are unlikely to reimburse a price higher than the flight fare.
3. Cost-Benefit Analysis  and Breakeven Calculation
So, to match the airlines, we need to have at least 20 high-speed train departures each way every day, for instance, say hourly departure between 4am and 11pm.
Given our one-way travel time of 3 hours and say, another hour for cleaning, unloading, train inspection, etc., we need at least 4 trains for hourly departure in both Beijing and Shanghai, for a total of 8 trains at least. Given USD $50,000 per high-speed train per day, the total variable costs will be $50,000 * 8 = $400,000 per day.
If we are able to capture 100% of the airline market and charge $500 each round trip, we have $500 per round trip * 20 round trips * 150 passengers per round trip = $1.5 million in revenue per day. But is it realistic for us to capture 100% of the airline market?
At this stage, the candidate should ask for the penetration rate for similar projects. The interviewer can tell the candidate that the Thai government built a similar high-speed railroad system in Thailand before and their penetration rate was about 30% after three years.
If we assume a similar penetration rate for the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, i.e. 30%, then daily revenue will be $1.5 million * 30% = $450,000, which is $50,000 higher than our daily cost of $400,000.
Break-even point
Given that the project has a fixed costs of USD $2.5 billion for infrastructure, it would take the Chinese Ministry of Railways roughly $2.5 billion / $50,000 per day = 50,000 days, or 50,000 days / 365 days per year ~= 140 years to break even.
4. Final Recommendation
Now, ask the candidate to present a summary and recommendation at this point. Based on financial considerations, this project will be profitable eventually, but it will need to take 140 years to breakeven. Whether this is a “go” or “no-go” decision is totally up to the candidate.
The candidate should also explore other use of the new railroad, e.g. transportation of perishable goods, express mail, etc. (Note to the interviewer: for this case, we expect passenger fare to be the major source of income.)

It currently is the second largest pharmaceutical company in the world in terms of revenue (USD $58.5 billion in 2011). Novartis was created in  1996 from the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz Laboratories, both Swiss companies with long histories.

new business,Booz & Company,"automotive, motor vehicles","Case Interview Question #00583: AAA (Triple A, formerly known as the American Automobile Association) is a federation of 51 independently operated motor clubs throughout North America. AAA is a not-for-profit member service organization with more than 51 million members. AAA provides services to its members such as  travel, automotive, insurance, financial, and discounts. Its national headquarters are in Heathrow, Florida.
Our client in this case is Chicago Motor Club, one of the 51 AAA motor clubs. The Chicago Motor Club primarily provides emergency roadside assistance services to its members. These services include jump starting an automobile, towing a vehicle, helping to change a flat tire, providing a small amount of fuel when a vehicle  runs out of it, pulling out a vehicle that is stuck in snow or helping people who are locked out of their cars. The club members pay a yearly $50 subscription fee regardless of the number of service requests they make every year.
A typical scenario is that a person has trouble starting the car and calls the AAA service center. The AAA service center then sends the nearest service van to the member. The mechanic will then try to resolve the minor defect. In case the car needs serious repair, the service van will tow it to the nearest official dealer or repair shop where our member can have the car repaired. Internal statistics indicate that the average time before a service person reaches the client is 25 minutes in the greater Chicago metropolitan area. On average the defect is resolved within 12 minutes.
A recent customer satisfaction survey revealed that 85% of the Chicago Motor Club AAA members are happy with the service. Remarkably, 20% of the members indicated that they would be willing to pay up to 10 times the current price if they were sure to have a service mechanic to help them within 30 minutes.
With this data, our client, the president of Chicago Motor Club, asked us to determine whether they should start a new service for the 20% of the members (called premium) that are willing to pay more. What would you recommend?

2. Adult Mortality due to injuries (half of all citizens who make it to age 5 die before reaching their 60th birthday at an average age of 30 years; of those, 10% die from injuries)
3. Senior mortality due to infections (of those who survive to age 60, 40% die from infections and 60% die of natural causes)

Company policy dictates that locations cannot be more than 500 miles from its suburban Los Angeles distribution center so that the meat and produce do not have to be frozen. Indeed, much of the company’s marketing revolves around the theme of never freezing its ingredients. The expansion has also been characterized by locations along major interstate highway routes, for example, along Interstate 5, which runs north south through California and all the way north to the US-Canada border and Interstate 15, which runs from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Nevada, In-N-Out Burger’s first out-of-state location.
Recently In-N-Out Burger’s management is considering expanding to the Pacific Northwest (a region in northwestern North America including the U.S. states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho, as well as the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of the Yukon) so that it will be poised for expansion into Canada. The company has hired you to help advise them whether or not to proceed with the expansion. What would you recommend?

Based in Chicago, Illinois and founded in 1990 by Mr. Kenneth Griffin, the firm Citadel today deploys capital across multiple asset classes and strategies. Currently Citadel manages $11 billion in assets under management (AUM) and is one of the world’s largest hedge fund managers.
Mr. Kenneth Griffin originally developed the hedge fund’s proprietary investment strategy over numerous hard working hours and many years of painstaking research. The investment strategy can be summarized as such:
The hedge fund combines a proprietary computer program along with its fundamental analysis to enhance its security selection process. The computer program first short-lists the companies based on criteria such as market capitalization, liquidity of securities and foreign exchange risk. If so desired it then works out a recommended position to take based on weighted assessments along dimensions such as market multiples-based valuation and bond yield-curve shape.
The fundamental analysis department then takes over, performing further research and analysis, and finally deciding on the position that the fund should take. The fundamental analysis department currently has a staff of 9 consisting of: 3 senior analysts (who, incidentally, are also the 3 partners of the firm), 4 junior analysts (MBA level), and 2 assistants (fresh college graduates).
Currently, of the 250 companies that the proprietary program shortlists, based on preliminary criteria, only 100 or so get analyzed every year. The hedge fund partners feel that significant opportunities are being left on the table, and would like to see how they can improve the situation, such as possibly hiring more staff or investing money in more advanced technology.

Possible Approach:
The best approach for an estimation or guesstimate case question is to think of a funnel. You begin by thinking broadly, then slowly drill down towards the answer. Let’s look at the approach in context. Referring to this particular case question, you know that you are looking for how many ping-pong balls fit in a 747 airplane. The first thing you need to determine is the volume of the ping-pong ball.
For any guesstimate/estimation case question you will need to understand whether your interviewer will be providing any direction or whether you will have to make assumptions. Therefore, begin your analysis of a guesstimate or estimation case question with a question to your interviewer, such as “What is the volume of a single ping pong ball?” If the interviewer does not know or refuses to provide any answer, then you will know that you must figure out the answer first. If the interviewer does provide the information, then your approach will be a series of questions. For this example, let’s assume your interviewer wants you to make the assumptions.

Currently Wells Fargo is one of the Big Four banks of the United States, the fourth largest by assets (after J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America), the second largest by market capitalization, and the second largest in deposits, home mortgage servicing, and debit card.
Let’s suppose you are working for the Division Head of Wells Fargo’s home mortgage business in San Francisco which lends to individual home buyers. The Head of home mortgage reads about a bank in Florida that is offering reverse mortgages. He wants to know if his division should offer this product or not. How would you help him make a decision?
Additional Information:
What is a Reverse Mortgage?
A Reverse Mortgage, as the name implies, is the inversion of a normal mortgage. The bank pays you an annuity stream in exchange for the proceeds from your house when it is sold. The sale happens when you die or go into the nursing home. The bank will only provide a reverse mortgage for up to 50% of the market value of the house.
A reverse mortgage is a loan available to seniors aged 62 or older, under a Federal program administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. It enables eligible homeowners to access a portion of their equity. The homeowners can draw the mortgage principal in a lump sum, by receiving monthly payments over a specified term or over their (joint) lifetimes, as a revolving line of credit, or some combination thereof. The homeowners’ obligation to repay the loan is deferred until owner (or survivor of two) dies, the home is sold, they cease to live in the property, or they breach the provisions of the mortgage (such as failure to maintain the property in good repair, pay property taxes, and keep the property insured against fire, etc).

Ask the candidates about what could be the SG&A costs (Selling, General & Administrative Expense), pick up a department like IT or engineering and ask how costs could be reduced in these departments.
If asked by the candidate, there are 15,000 employees in the IT department. Some 3,000 engineers work on scheduling and shipping algorithms.
If the candidate suggests layoffs as a possible cost reduction strategy, ask her/him on how she/he will communicate it to the CEO.

(Euronext: AKZA) is a multinational chemical company active in the fields of decorative paints, performance coatings and specialty chemicals. Headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, the company has activities in more than 80 countries  with revenue of euro €14.6 billion in fiscal year 2010.
One division of Akzo Nobel makes a specialty chemical, used as thickening agent (a.k.a. thickeners, substances which increase the viscosity of a solution or liquid/solid mixture) in foods and oil wells. The firm holds a patent on the substance but suspects that a substitute will be invented by a competitor in approximately one year. Is this new substitute a threat to the client’s thickening agent product?
Additional Information: (to be provided to you if asked)
1. Product
The thickening agent is used in foods like gelatin, gummy bears, etc. In oil wells it is used to keep the head on. All of the inputs to the product are commodities.
2. Market
The food market uses 200,000 lbs/year and the oil market uses 50,000 lbs/year. The industry is mature with relatively little growth. The client Akzo Nobel has many customers, especially in the food segment.
In the oil well segment, the product represents a very small percentage of the total cost of production, but the product’s failure has large downside risk implications. If the thickening agent fails, causing the head to pop off, it can create large losses for the oil company. Hence, the oil company purchasing decision is primarily based on quality and reliability.
In the food segment, the thickening agent represents about 50 percent of the total costs.
3. Company
Due to the monopoly the client currently enjoys, margins for the product are very high. The firm currently charges the same price in both food and oil well segments. The client Akzo Nobel has a strong reputation for both quality and reliability.

The Nature Conservancy has a division that maintains a database that tracks the biodiversity (all of the different types of plants) in the United States. This information includes how many plants of each type of plant are included in certain sections of each state.
The data was collected by volunteers in each of the 50 states. There was one volunteer organization per each of the fifty states who would collect the data and send it to Washington DC. This division of The Nature Conservancy was created 20 years ago to help the parent company to determine which lands to buy and protect. The parent company began to think that maybe other people would be interested in using this data. They recently agreed to spin the division off as its own separate entity.
I want to give you deeper detail about the volunteer organizations that collect the data. There were some volunteers who called themselves Nature Conservancy affiliates who only collected data for the parent organization. There were some volunteer groups who were nature conservation organizations themselves and who did the collection as only a part of their total mission and services. Finally, there were some universities / biology departments who worked to collect the data and share the data with The Nature Conservancy. It was noted that some of the data collectors dropped out of the system every once in a while and that people actually had to pay a nominal fee in order to be a data collector for the parent company.  
There were three main requirements of the spin-off:
1. The parent company The Nature Conservancy allowed the spin-off to keep all of its people, office equipment and buildings, but the spin-off would have to be financially responsible for themselves.
2. The parent company would in-turn provide a tapering grant (going to zero after a couple of years) back to the spin-off for expenses.
3. The spin-off would be required to hire Bridgespan Group to help them design a strategic business plan for survival.

(NASDAQ: DCLK, acquired by Google for USD $3.1 billion in March 2008) is a technology company headquartered in New York City, New York, USA. The client is in the business of online advertising, providing Internet ad management and serving services. They generate revenues by placing ads (links, text, image, video, and rich media ads) on websites of other web content publishers, e.g. Wall Street Journal’s WSJ.com, America Online’s aol.com.
DoubleClick currently has ~500,000 clients (web content publishers) who are grouped into three tiers, based on their web traffic. Tier A are big online content networks with billions of page views and ad impressions per month. Tier B and Tier C are medium-sized web content publishers and small online content providers with millions of page views per month.
DoubleClick recently invested $80M in implementing a program that optimized customer service for clients in Tier A. The new program resulted in increased revenue per publisher (customer) within Tier A by 20% (based on initial data). The program involves a customer service representative looking at a customer website and offering customized ad design and placement recommendations for each publisher. Better ad design and placement would result in a much higher click through rate (CTR) for the ad, thus increasing DoubleClick’s revenues.
Now, your client DoubleClick is considering rolling out this new program to the other two Tiers and has hired you to assist them with the implementation.

Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, United States, the company is mainly engaged in the business of rail freight hauling. A freight train is a group of freight cars hauled by one or more locomotives on a railway, ultimately transporting cargo between two points as part of the logistics chain. Trains may haul bulk material, intermodal containers, general freight or specialized freight in purpose-designed cars.
The client company’s business fundamentals continue to be solid, but recently it has struggled in generating the strong shareholder return that is characteristic of the company and its peer group. Very concerned, the CEO of BNSF Railway has  retained your consulting firm to look into the issue. What has caused the decline in client’s shareholder return and how should the CEO address the problem?
Additional Information: (to be revealed to the candidate during the course of the case interview)
The US freight railway industry is very mature.
Companies in the railway industry tend to generate a lot of cash – once significant fixed costs are incurred, business has relatively low variable costs (fuel is the major one, but fuel costs can’t be major cause of the problem because it affects the entire industry).
There are four major companies in the US railway industry – two in the West (Union Pacific Railroad, BNSF Railway) and two in the East (CSX Railroad, Norfolk Southern Railway). All competitors have roughly the same national market share. The small number of total competitors is due to significant recent consolidation in the industry.
Service is non-contiguous between the East and West and transnational service is only a very small segment of the overall market.
Our client competes only in the West. In this market segment, 75% of revenue (mainly coal, automobiles, and general merchandise) is served by our client and the main competitor Union Pacific Railroad (almost equal market share). Of the remaining 25% (mainly chemical and agriculture), 10% is served by our client and 15% is served by the competitor Union Pacific Railroad.
Revenue growth generally comes from acquisition – typically market shares remain relatively constant (nobody steals too much market share).
Market segments served by the client are the following:
Client company is one of more profitable in the industry. They have been able to generate cost savings of approximately 10% per year for the last five years.
Our client company was formed recently (15 months ago) through the merger of two railway companies of equal size – Chicago, Illinois-based Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (often called the “Santa Fe”) was merged into Houston, Texas-based Burlington Northern Railroad.

1. Is this a good idea or not?
2. What are the potential risks/issues that Subway must consider?
Additional Information: (to be provided to you if asked)
For every $1.00 a customer spends in any Subway stores, they get 1 point. The frequent eater plan is to give away coupon that can be redeemed for a free sandwich once a customer accumulates 20 points.
Candidate can start working assuming an average store and fine-tune later. An average Subway store has around 8,000 ‘heavy’ eaters and 12,000 ‘light eaters’ per year – segmentations beyond ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ are not very relevant for this case.
Market research survey indicates that heavy eaters will increase the frequency of visits from 30 to 36 times a year; light users will increase frequency of visits from 10 to 12 times a year.
Customers spend an average of $5.00 for every visit – this is the same for both heavy and light eaters. Heavy users just come more often.
Around 20% of the heavy users are expected to participate in the frequent eater program. Around 5% of the light users are expected to participate.
The “give-away” free sandwiches cost $2.00 to make and there is a 50% gross margin on the average items sold.

Notes:
Game theory suggests that cartels are inherently unstable, as the behaviour of members of a cartel is an example of a prisoner’s dilemma. Each member of a cartel would be able to make more profit by breaking the agreement (producing a greater quantity or selling at a lower price than that agreed) than it could make by abiding by it. However, if all members break the agreement, all will be worse off.

Their business has been stagnating in recent years. They are located in a low to middle-income area and in the past have only sold cars to customers who are willing to pay 100% of the cost up-front or can obtain bank financing. In order to boost sales, CarMax is considering offering car loans to customers that the dealership itself will finance.
To be eligible for a loan, customers must undergo a complete credit check (which we assume to be accurate). The credit check rates potential car buyers on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to a 0% chance of paying off the loan and 100 corresponds to a 100% chance of paying the loan in full. Each loan only lasts 1 year in which payments are made monthly and the entire loan will be paid off in 1 year’s time. Buyers ultimately fall into two categories, those that pay off the loan entirely, and those that default.

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chicago, Illinois-based Bank One Corporation (NYSE: ONE) has just announced that Bank One has completed the acquisition of First USA Inc. (NYSE: FUS), headquartered in Dallas, Texas. First USA is a financial services company specializing in the credit card business and is currently the fourth largest among domestic Visa and MasterCard issuers with $23.2 billion in managed receivables and 16.3 million cardholders.
With assets of $101.6 billion and common equity of $8.2 billion, Bank One provides the full range of commercial banking and financial services, whereas First USA only provided credit card service. The management of Bank One has decided that after the completion of the merger, First USA will run their combined credit card department.

Headquartered in Warren, Michigan, the GM Research Lab is a very innovative place which employs about 100 scientists and engineers who buy components and create prototype innovative products for cars. This place is bursting with energy, and they already have many great products to their credit. For instance, they have already developed a prototype car autopilot navigation system.
Similarly, they discovered that many of the road deaths due to car accidents are preventable. The problem is that medical services don’t reach there in time either because they don’t get to know about the accident at all or they don’t know exactly where it happened. In most such accidents, the victims either lose consciousness or are decapacitated. So they have created this device which is a combination of GPS, airbags and cell phones. The way it works is that on car accident impact, the airbags inflate, and the cell phone calls 911, pinpointing the directions using the GPS (think of GM OnStar, Ford Sync, BMW Assist, Toyota/Lexus Safety Connect, etc).
These guys are full of ideas, and some of the projects under consideration are night-vision for cars (using F-14 technology), backing sensors and so on. However, their costs range is high. The fundamental issue is that the engineers are like kids in a candy shop. They are doing very exciting work and love their jobs. However, there are random projects going on all over the place. The president wants to streamline the operations and focus on 10-20 projects rather than the more than 100 that are going on right now.

Possible Answer:
This is a classical population-based market sizing case question. One of the many possible approaches is to start by looking at the total US population, divide total US population into different groups based on age, consuming habit, usage frequency, etc, and assign a consuming frequency or usage rate for the target product/service to each population group. Then, sum them up to get the final total market size. Also, remember to use round numbers, and round up or round down to simplify your calculations. Here what matters is not how accurate your final number is, but the analytical problem solving skills and thinking process through which you reach your final number.
A way to size the U.S. market for razor-blades is outlined below:
1. Total population of USA = 300 million. (sort of a common sense)

organizational behavior | reduce costs,Schlumberger Business Consulting (SBC),"Oil, Gas & Petroleum Industry","Case Interview Question #00307: Your client Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) is an American multinational oil company headquartered in San Ramon, California, United States. It is engaged in every aspect of the oil, gas, and geothermal energy industries, including exploration and production; refining, marketing and transport; chemicals manufacturing and sales; and power generation.
The case mainly concerns the upstream business of Chevron. The upstream business, also called “exploration and production”, is the part of the company that explores for and pumps oil out of the ground. Management of Chevron’s upstream business has called you in because the company’s profitability has declined relative to its peer group (other major oil companies like ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Total S.A., ConocoPhillips, etc), and they would like to find ways to improve performance. Since oil is a commodity, the primary way to improve profitability is through cost reductions, either by reducing operating costs (cost per barrel produced) or by reducing “finding and developing” costs (investments per barrel of oil discovered).
A key point that is helpful to evaluating this case is to understand that performance improvement can be achieved through efficiency gains (i.e., doing the same work at a lower cost) or effectiveness gains (i.e., achieving better results for the same cost). In the oil industry, this translates into either lower actual operating costs or higher volumes over which to spread costs.
Your client has asked you to evaluate the viability of two different options:
1. Reorganize the company along geographic lines (i.e., focus on regional businesses), reducing headquarters overhead charges by shifting administrative responsibility to regional businesses and eliminating a layer of administration.
2. Form joint ventures (i.e., subsidiaries jointly owned by your client and a partner) with competitors in each region to realize cooperative opportunities and resulting savings.
Discuss the merits of each alternative.

Western Refining Company, although profitable, believes it is lagging behind the competition and could further improve its profitability. You are brought in as part of a joint consultant-client team that will review their overall operations and make recommendations on ways to improve the bottom line.
As a management consultant, you have been assigned to work with the maintenance division of the client company. Question to you:
1. What opportunities exist to increase profits?
2. What recommendations can you make to capture savings related to the identified opportunities?
3. What are the cost savings associated with your recommendations?
Additional Information:
The maintenance department’s primary objective is to prevent equipment failure and to repair equipment when it does fail. Understanding of its organization is important. It consists of three primary areas: nine assets areas, one central maintenance area and one group of contractors. The first two areas are employees of the client, the third an external source of labor.
An Asset is a physical area of the plant that contains various pieces of equipment (pumps, heat exchangers, etc.). There are nine assets. Each asset has a Maintenance Supervisor who is responsible for all maintenance to be performed in his/her asset. Working for the Maintenance Supervisor in each asset is, on average, eleven “craftsmen”. The craftsmen are the actual workers that perform the maintenance.  The craftsmen are unionized and divide into twelve different craft designations (e.g. electricians, pipefitters, welders, etc.). Each craft designation has a defined set of skills they are qualified to perform. They are not allowed to perform skills outside of their defined craft, or help in the performance of activities involving skills beyond their craft. Collectively the twelve different crafts can perform any maintenance job that might arise at the refinery. The maintenance supervisor and his/her assigned craftsmen are “hardwired” to their asset. That is, they work only on equipment in their given asset.
Central Maintenance is a centralized pool of Maintenance Supervisors and Craftsmen, who are dispatched to support the different assets during times of high workload. They are employees of your client and fit the description contained in the above Asset explanation. The only difference is that they may work in any of the different assets as determined by workload. There are a total of 11 Maintenance Supervisors and 100 Craftsmen that comprise Central Maintenance.
Contractors are a group of outside Supervisors and Craftsmen who support your client during times of high workload. They also are capable of performing any maintenance job that may arise, but differ from your client’s Craftsmen in that they divide the collective skills required into five designations rather than twelve. Thus, the craftsmen of the contractor are capable of performing a broader set of skills. They, like your client’s craftsmen, don’t perform skills outside of their defined craft but do allow different craft designations to help each other. There are an average of 7 contractor Maintenance Supervisors and 140 contractor Craftsmen at the refinery on any given day.

Possible Answer:
More people play football than watch a football match in the UK.
At first sight this looks like a brainteaser question. The job candidate should realize that it can be solved as an estimation/guesstimate or market sizing case. The key to approaching this type of case questions is: to start by clarifying the question; then to identify any assumptions you can make to simplify the problem; next to break down the problem logically, before finally getting into the detail of the numbers. Interviewers will be impressed with people who can approach a problem conceptually, and also who can find ways of getting to a roughly right or “80/20” version of the truth quickly, which can be refined later.
1. Start by raising any questions you have to clarify the parameters of the analysis.
In this case, you might want to confirm that “watching a football match” means watching a match in person, not on TV; and that “playing in a match” means playing in an organized manner with 2 full teams and a defined pitch, rather than a kick-about with friends in the local park, or with your kids in the garden. Football could include 5-a-side as well as full XIs, but does not include non-standard football, e.g. Eton Fives or other variants.You need to log in to access the rest of the page.

estimate/guesstimate,Oliver Wyman,mass media & communications,"Case Interview Question #00289: How many words are there in the daily edition of The Times?
Possible Answer:
When faced with a structured estimation/guesstimate type case question such as this one, it is essential to make your assumptions and thought-process as clear as possible at the very beginning of the interview. You should start by laying out any key principles which will help you simplify the problem – getting the answer exactly right isn’t required. 
In this example, the key principle is to come up with the number of text-only pages in a standard copy, and combine this with an estimate of words per text-only page. One way of simplifying the problem is to exclude text in advertisements and diagrams, to make it easier to covert a standard page into a fraction of text-only page. Another simplification is to exclude any additional supplements.
Once you have set out any key principles and simplifying assumptions, break the problem into sub-questions or a logic flow to show the interviewer how you are thinking. One possible set of sub-questions is shown below:
1. On average, how pages are there in the daily Times, excluding supplements?
2. How much of the paper is taken up by advertisements?
3. What fraction of news story pages is taken up with images or diagrams?
4. What is the number of words on a text-only page?

Possible Answer:
For this type of structured estimation/guesstimate case question, it is especially important to make your assumptions and thought process clear. You will be expected to make some simplifications as you go along. Getting the answer exactly right isn’t required.
You should start by stating any restrictions you are going to make to simplify the problem or make the scope more manageable. For example, you might want to consider operation during peak times only, and only cover trains actually in operation – excluding trains not in service, sitting in sidings etc. In addition, you might want to clarify that the London Underground excludes the DLR.
Next break the problem into sub-questions or a logic flow to show the interviewer how you are thinking and that you grasp the key principles required to solve the problem. For example, for this question one key principle to establish at the start is the idea of “routes” or branches, rather than individual lines (a complex line such as the Northern line consists of several branches, and each train serves a particular branch rather than the entire line).

The Strategic Change group is the strategy thought leader in PwC. The engagement partner in Consumer Products group has come to SC to help develop a strategy for Unilever USA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of British-Dutch multi-national conglomerate Unilever Group (LSE: ULVR, NYSE: UN for Unilever N.V., NYSE: UL for Unilever PLC). This engagement has the potential of positioning PwC to Unilever USA and its parent conglomerate Unilever Group for the next five, possible ten years. You have been assigned to this engagement, how would you go about developing a business strategy for the client?
Additional Information:
The following additional information will be provided to you during the case interview.
Client Company Background
Unilever USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of multi-national conglomerate Unilever Group. The conglomerate owns ten companies operating in the U.S. Unilever USA is the largest of the ten. Unilever USA is a consumer goods company distributing well-known branded products through grocery, drug, mass merchant and club channels. With $4 billion in revenues, Unilever USA is one of the top three players in the consumer goods industry in the U.S. The company has been marginally profitable over the past ten years. Last year the company made a profit due largely to an accounting change.
Although Unilever USA only operates in the U.S., it owns several manufacturing and distribution facilities around the world to support its production and distribution systems. Unilever USA takes advantage of lower labor costs in Mexico, Canada and Southeast Asia to lower its manufacturing costs. Unilever USA still maintains three plants in the U.S. Because of the over-capacity that Unilever USA has experienced, Unilever USA has negotiated deals with sister companies overseas to manufacture and direct-ship product.
Unilever USA has four market segments that operate as profit centers. The market segments are: Personal Hygiene, Consumer Tissue, Soaps and Detergents and Personal Care. Even though the revenues are roughly evenly divided among all four market segments, Personal Care contributes 90% of the company’s profits. In Personal Care, Unilever USA owns the two top branded products, in the other categories the company has the number two brand, and in one segment, number three. Unilever USA has committed to building a consumer franchise through aggressive advertising and in-store merchandising support.
Consumer Products Industry Trends
In the U.S., brands are under attack from private labels, who are now competing on both price and quality. Brands are looking to justify their price premiums. The value of being the number one brand cannot be taken lightly. The return on sales of the top brand is almost twice that of the number two brand. The return on sales for the number two brand is twice that of the number three brand.
The power of the retail industry in the U.S. has increased dramatically over the past five years. The retailers are driving additional costs upon manufacturers. With established products, retailers are demanding a minimal level of turns per year. With new products, retailers are demanding slotting fees and ever-increasing promotional support. Product managers are forced to achieve current product revenue and market share goals while stimulating demand for new products. Many industry experts feel that there will be consolidation of brands within many of the market segments in which Unilever USA competes and, as a result of this brand consolidation, that Unilever USA will lose critical sales mass and become a major casualty.
In the last two years the allocation of marketing dollars has changed dramatically; trade promotion has risen to 40% of total marketing spending, consumer promotion has climbed slightly and advertising has declined. Industry analysts have pointed to Unilever USA’s trade promotion strategy as being the catalyst for the growth in trade promotion in the industry as competitors have been forced to respond.
Unilever USA is widely regarded as a retail-oriented company. With a sales force that is twice the size of anyone else’s in the industry, Unilever USA has forged great retail relationships over the years. Unilever USA traditionally had the best order fill rate in the business; however, recently some of the efforts to reduce inventory has caused shortages in key promoted products.
Unilever USA Organization Structure
There are six Executive Vice Presidents (EVPs) in Unilever USA responsible for functional areas. All the EVPs report to the President, who is also CEO. The Executive Vice Presidents represent Marketing, Sales, Finance, Manufacturing, Engineering and Human Resources. The EVP of Finance has responsibility for financial reporting and analyses as well as managing Procurement, Deployment, Scheduling and Logistics. All the market segment managers report directly to the Executive Vice President of Marketing.
Much of the blame for the performance of the company over the last ten years fell on the shoulders of the former president. It was whispered that he was from the “old school” and could not change his ways. The new president of Unilever USA, an American, joined the company six months ago. He was the Executive Vice President of an important European division of a sister company. The conglomerate has always prided itself on being able to leverage its multi-national resources.
Unilever USA Current Situation
Venn Teldren, the Executive Vice President of Finance, is considered to be a brilliant man by many in the industry. Born and raised in Europe, Mr. Teldren rose quickly through the organization. However, because of his outspoken nature, he angered enough senior level executives (“showed up” as Mr. Teldren would say) that he has never received a position of president, even though his name is mentioned every time an opening appears.
Recently the vice chairperson of the conglomerate responsible for the group in which Unilever USA is a member, sat down with the Unilever USA President and EVPs. The vice chairperson stated that the company needed to improve performance within one year. He offered a couple of scenarios of what the conglomerate was considering in the event that the management failed to improve profitability.
Scenario 1:  Drop unprofitable brands and reduce the size of the company.
Scenario 2:  Merge the company with a sister company that has similar distribution requirements and have proven profitability.
Recent Initiatives
Unilever USA has recently taken part in an industry-wide study called Efficient Customer Response or ECR. The study found that an industry-wide effort to develop  more efficient trade practices and delivery systems could save an aggregated $30 billion dollars a year. PwC assisted Unilever USA in this study. All the EVPs agree that there are huge dollar savings that can be achieved with efficiency improvements.
Venn believes that the supply chain (i.e., Procurement, Manufacturing, Deployment, Scheduling, Logistics, and Warehousing) can become a strategic advantage for the company if it can outperform its competitors. PwC studies have shown that improvements cannot be made without the input or the support of all the functional areas of the company, especially Marketing and Sales. The EVPs from Marketing and Sales do not always see the Supply Chain as key players; in fact, the EVPs of Marketing and Sales see the Supply Chain as only a vendor to them.
Venn knows that the results of the ECR initiative may not be enough to rally support among the EVPs. Venn knows that whatever strategy is accepted needs to define the roles of each of the EVPs and to provide an outlet for each EVP to demonstrate his and her skills. He is also aware that the other EVPs are very conscious of the growth of Venn’s power. Each EVP will initiate a project with the assumption that the architect of the solution to Unilever USA’s current situation will be in position for the next presidency.
The EVP of Human Resource has championed the need to implement a whole new way of envisioning the company working together. She has envisioned a flatter organization and has spent years developing studies with another leading consultancy to support her vision. She has a strong supporter in the EVP of Sales. The present EVP of Sales was originally from Human Resources. Her vision has always entailed an extensive re-structuring and re-training effort.
The EVP of Engineering feels that the company needs to invest in its new product capability. The strategy is to acquire smaller, regional companies that are producing differentiated products. “We can absorb them into us and stimulate our new product pipeline,” he stated. “With these new, regionally proven products, we can fill capacity and leverage our distribution and sales strength. I can also energize my area with fresh ideas. It’s win-win, no doubt about it.”
The EVP of Manufacturing is sick and tired of hearing that manufacturing is the problem. He points to the fact that they re producing and shipping three times the product they were five years ago with the same number of people they had eight years ago. If things don’t change in other areas, then things won’t change in Manufacturing, other than the inability to support the orders coming in.
The EVP of Marketing believes that a combination of re-structuring and acquisition is needed. He wants to reduce the salesperson’s role with the retailer and focus on consumer spending behind a “high quality” message grounded in tangible product benefits across all product segments. He wants to broaden the product mix with new products from acquisition.
The Engagement
Venn has mentioned to Gary Forstman, the PwC engagement partner, that he is willing to devote the necessary resources in his functional areas to prove out the right strategy to the other EVPs. Venn has also indicated that the company is willing to devote significant resources and capabilities to the right effort. “All the EVPs know,” he said, “that there will be whole-scale changes if the company doesn’t turn itself about.”
Mr. Forstman has called Grady Means, PwC Strategic Business Unit (SBU) leader and partner, and said, “This is PricewaterhouseCoopers’ first major engagement with Unilever USA after several years of smaller engagements where we were able to demonstrate our ability to implement solutions. Now we have an opportunity to really shine. The company is re-evaluating its strategic position and has asked several consulting firms to talk to them.” Grady discussed the situation with PwC partner, Michael Hanley, and they agreed that you would be a great person to work on this project. You receive a call from Grady. After exchanging pleasantries, Grady explains the situation to you: “We need some dynamic thinking on this one. I know Venn Teldren from years ago. Venn is going to be all over us if we don’t get this right. What’s important is that we show Venn that we have a vision of where the company needs to go, how the parts fit together and how they are going to get there. What is important is that our analysis is fact-based. We need to be ready to say to Venn, ‘This is the situation, this is the problem, this is the solution and this is step one, step two, step three on what you need to do tomorrow.’  This is a big opportunity for us and I’m counting on you. See what you can come up with by this time next week. Feel free to call Michael or myself with any questions. Okay, talk to you soon.”

Telekinesis is modestly profitable, with $131 million in sales last year and approximately 200,000 customers spread out over four adjacent, mostly rural geographies. PricwaterhouseCoopers has worked for Telekinesis Inc. in the past, but has not done any significant work for over a year and a half. This is PricwaterhouseCoopers’ first substantial engagement with the company. As a consultant assigned to this project by a PwC partner, how would you go about developing an Business/IT strategy for the client?
Additional Information:
The following additional information will be provided to you during the case interview.
Client Company Background
The client Telekinesis Inc. was formed in 1992 by executives from four former Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) and two principals in Silicon Valley technology start-ups. One of the principals is from a start-up company that pioneered a new kind of wireless propagation technology.
Telekinesis was founded on the principle that the current telecommunications industry is populated with companies who are almost congenitally incapable of optimizing their form of organization and culture to meet the competitive challenges of the 1990s. The founders believe that local loop technology, which relies on communication devices which are peers in a large technology community, where every device has a permanent and unchangeable identification, is the silver bullet of the telecommunications industry, and that the RBOCs are not ready or willing to exploit it. Local loop technology (LLT) is considered by RBOC management to be radical, unproven and unreliable.
Telekinesis Inc. is modestly profitable, with $131 million in sales and approximately 200,000 customers spread out over four adjacent, mostly rural geographies. Approximately 90% of its sales come from four small local telephone companies. The company’s strategy is to use the operating experience and customer positioning of  the four local telephone companies to develop and implement local loop wireless service or LLWS (often pronounced “laws”). The concept behind this service is based on the fact that the current phone companies control wiring to and from a central office facility. This facility is in effect a big switching box. The central office acts like a big hub with many spokes radiating from it. LLWS eliminates the central office and substitutes simple, unobtrusive, premises wireless relay equipment. There is at least one local loop server facility that is somewhat analogous to a central office but  not needed to maintain service. The server facility is used to monitor quality and provide a trap for billing.
Local loop wireless services are fully integrated. They include telephonic communication as well as cellular, pager, on-demand video, and “highway” services. Highway services permit companies within the local loop to communicate with each other as if they were on a large universal local area network. Computers located in both home and office are immediately interconnected by the local loop. Importantly, there are literally no wires involved in any of these services (except of course for plugging into the wall to get electricity). Physical customer hook-ups are non-existent. Customers are granted access, and services and information are secured through software interfaces in LLWS devices, such as television sets, laptop computers, pagers, etc. Telekinesis has a number of arrangements with software and hardware vendors to create LLWS devices.
Understandably, the industry discounts LLWS as another “high tech California fantasy.” Bell Core engineers, while acknowledging the future potential of local loop technology, dispute Telekinesis’s claims that the bandwidth and quality is actually present in production, commercially available products to be installed in the real world.
Telekinesis’ doctrine is to completely convert all 200,000 current subscribers of the four local phone companies at once, with no phase in.  Each of the four local companies will be converted separately.
Telekinesis bought the four local phone companies in order to have large scale pilot sites for local loop wireless services. Telekinesis’ fundamental business proposition is that the changing regulatory landscape will allow it to compete with local Bell telephone companies, providing a higher performance, lower cost alternative to the existing local phone companies for local and long-distance telephone service, paging, cable t.v., and cellular phones.
Telecommunications Industry Trends
The early 1980s were a time of turmoil for the telecommunications industry.  For the first time in  history, AT&T was deregulated and lost its monopoly status.  This meant competition for AT&T where none had existed before.  Long-distance was the arena of competition.
“Telecommunications” includes much more than simply making a phone-call.  It encompasses cable television service and network connectivity which brings interactive television, shopping forums, education and information services into the home.  The phone lines that the telecommunications companies control enable computers to communicate from remote locations, and can gather information from databases and news services around the world within seconds.
The possibilities for profits in this arena are practically limitless, and the sphere of competition is expanding.  Up to 1994, only long-distance carriers were in competition, but local calling areas are going to be opened up for competition in the late 1990s.
Telekinesis Organization Structure
There are currently three business units: 1) residential, which is divided into the “plain vanilla” customers that have only one phone line into the house and no add-ons such as cellular phones, pagers, additional lines, etc. and 2) residential customers who have add-on services and are good candidates for taking advantage of the new technology; and 3) small business. Each of Telekinesis’s business units has a President who  reports to the CEO. In addition, R&D and Technology Assurance, essentially a quality management program, also report directly to the CEO. Telekinesis is tightly controlled by the principals who founded the company and all the senior positions just described are held by the founders.
There are really no Corporate functional areas such as Finance, Purchasing, Distribution, and Human Resources. These functions exist  in the original phone companies as they did  before the companies were acquired. An outsider with the title of Chief Financial Officer runs the Corporate functional area. She had a brief tenure as the CFO of an RBOC.  The Technology Assurance Group helps support the existing communications and networking infrastructure.
Telekinesis Current Situation
PricewaterhouseCoopers was retained because of their knowledge of the RBOCs and an audit relationship with the four local phone companies. They were retained by Telekinesis for special start-up services, legal and regulatory counsel and assistance in dealing with obtaining additional venture capital financing. Because of the technology nature of Telekinesis, the PricwaterhouseCoopers Financial Advisory Services partner contacted IT Strategic Services. The Firm has now been asked to deal with the operational dimensions of Telekinesis as it commences detailed tactical planning for LLWS activation.  Another management consulting firm is providing some business strategy consulting to Telekinesis.
PricewaterhouseCoopers has been asked to propose on three major stages of work: 1) process vision; 2) tactical doctrine; 3) infrastructure and value.  These are meant to give Telekinesis “process efficacy.”  This is their language.
The current company is, in effect, the combination of the four small southern telephone companies that were acquired and are now operated by Telekinesis. However, except for top management, the vast majority of employees of the telephone companies were retained, as were the administrative and operational support systems. Some of those employees are very excited to be able to participate in this opportunity, but a lot of the old timers are dubious and apprehensive.
All telephone company processes and functions are essentially the same as before the acquisition by Telekinesis. Telekinesis concentrated on establishing a simple, “no frills” system for collecting financial and operating information on the telephone companies but did virtually nothing to change the actual operations of the companies.
Marley and Cratchet (the two silicon valley entrepreneurs) expect that the consultant selected will be able to bring fresh creative ideas to the process of what they term is “…creating a 21st Century company for a 21st Century business.” Included in their definition of process efficacy is the notion of “enterprise extensibility,” or put more simply put the capability to seamless team with external suppliers in a variety of value-adding, integrative relationships that can be episodic or persistent. Particularly important is the aspect of Telekinesis strategy in which vendors will provide LLWS compatible devices to customers who will pay a one-time $15 fee for the equipment.
All four Telekinesis executives expect that the process efficacy initiatives will include information systems and technology strategy and planning. They want the consultant to provide a guaranteed “operational profile” that states that the recommended configuration of hardware and software, costing $xx and operational by 19yy will be able to support the local loop wireless service business.
There are four distinct flavours of legacy systems across the four companies. Hardware and software is different, with three of the companies having an IBM mainframe in addition to other computers. Telekinesis installed IMRS on a high end x486 computer to provide financial consolidation and reporting of the four companies. Spreadsheet disks prepared at month end are FedExed to Telekinesis home office in Bernardsville, New Jersey and loaded into IMRS.

Possible Answer:
To crack this market sizing case, you might begin by assuming that hotel-sized mini bottles of shampoo and/or conditioner are produced for two purposes only: 
1. To supply hotels and upscale motels.
2. To provide samples for gift packs, salons, and so on.
You would then want to start by estimating the number of hotels and motels around the world that offer the products to their guests. One way of estimating the number of hotels is to assume that hotels are found predominantly in major cities and resorts.

Possible Answer:
A logical place to begin your analysis might be to ballpark the number of pay phones on Manhattan street corners. If you think of New York City as a grid of streets, you might guess it is about 300 streets long (north to south) by ten streets wide (east to west), so it has approximately 3,000 intersections. You might then assume there is one pay phone for every two intersections, for a total of about 1,500 pay phones.
If you’re feeling really creative, you might subtract the number of intersections that are “invalidated” because they fall in the area of Central Park. Say Central Park is ten blocks long by two blocks wide, or 20 intersections.

The other day you met the Belgian Minister of State Owned Enterprises and he asked you whether it would be a good idea to privatize the National Lottery in Belgium (i.e. also to liberalize the market and to open it to the competition).
Before accepting the engagement, you perform a quick analysis of the situation in order to see whether the idea is worth spending more time on or not. Remember, your firm has a reputation of excellence to maintain and does not want to be involved in any projects that could potentially fail. What is your recommendation? Do you accept the project? Why is it a good or a bad idea to privatize Belgium’s National Lottery?
Additional Information:
Here are some background facts about the National Lottery industry in Belgium and previous privatizations.
The National Lottery enjoys a monopoly and offers different products. For all of them, the probability to win is fixed by the Government, as is the price of each ticket. By now, half of the bets must be returned to players. The other half goes to charities or development projects (that have to be financed anyway) after the distribution and administrative costs have been paid. Lottery tickets are distributed through newspapers kiosks and supermarkets who receive a fixed amount per ticket sold. Lottery gains are tax-free. 
In the recent years, the Belgian Government has privatized the telecom market and it has been a huge success. The incumbent and the new entrants make much more money than before. The Belgian Government is trying to reduce its debt and is looking for other privatization opportunities.

Oral-B’s product portfolio consists primarily of a “manual” toothbrush that retails for $3 and an electric “rechargeable” power toothbrush that retails for $50.

One year ago, a major competitor Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

Hint: (to be provided only if the interviewee struggles significantly with the initial structuring of the problem) The client typically views the market in terms of margins and “per customer per year” metrics.
One year ago, the worldwide market was made up of 80% manual and 20% rechargeable toothbrushes. The spinbrush’s 1% market share gain has come mostly at the expense of rechargeable toothbrush sales.

To crack this estimation/guesstimate type of case, the job candidate will need to come up with reasonable assumptions and keep the numbers and calculations as simple as possible.
1. Let’s say there are 5 runways at JFK airport, assume an airplane leaves/arrives every 6 minutes per runway, so 10 airplanes per hour per runway.
2. Common sense tells us that no flight is scheduled in late night or early morning. If we assume that planes don’t fly out and land between 12:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M., this will leave 20 hours that airplanes fly in and out.

2. The durability of this new technology is 3 years, i.e. the closest competitor will take 3 years to copy the unit.
3. Revenue/Cost of old unit v.s. new unit:
4. There are certain economies of scale expected as manufacturing produces more of the new units, as the volume increases to over 100,000 units, costs will decrease by 20%.
5. The candidate should notice that some costs are fixed and some are variable. Also that the external distributor is currently receiving $400 or 20% of the unit cost, will the company be able to keep the distributor at a fixed fee of $400 or will they argue for an increase to 20% of resale value?
6. The lifespan of the unit is 10 years.
7. The U.S. is split into 4 regions for air conditioning usage: Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest. Average expenditure for electricity running air conditioning per year: NE – $700 per year; NW – $300 per year; SE – $1500 per year; SW – $ 1200 per year.
8. How do people choose air conditioning units? — 80% of sales are made on ‘price’ of the unit. 20% of sales are made on the ‘lifetime value’ of the unit.
9. Goodman Global’s sales are 40% of total market, 30% to the price segment and 10% to the lifetime value segment. (Notice their old product appeals more to the lifetime value segment…the client has 50% of the lifetime value market)

Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, WESCO distributes more than half-million products (1.5 million SKUs) made by multiple manufacturer/suppliers through 256 branches and warehouses in the US. Given that they are the middle-men, margins in the distribution industry are very thin.

The company has been generally decentralized with a high degree of branch autonomy (branch and district managers are kings of their own domain). Each branch has its own processes with considerable off-system accounting and record keeping on Excel spreadsheets, etc. Given growth over the last decade, the home- grown mainframe computer system can no longer effectively handle the volume of transactions.

They will re-engineer most business processes (sales, marketing, forecasting, logistics, finance, customer service) and are implementing one system for everyone in the company that will provide real-time information and a 360 degree view of the business.

business turnaround,KPMG Consulting,entertainment & performing arts,"Case Interview Question #00187: Imagine that you are a consultant hired by Carnegie Hall, a large concert hall in New York City’s Midtown Manhattan. Carnegie Hall is one of the most prestigious venues in the world for both classical music and popular music. It has its own artistic programming, development, and marketing departments, and presents about 250 performances each season.
For the past several years, Carnegie Hall’s profits have been steadily declining and management is quite concerned. They want you to help them determine out how to reverse this trend and restore Carnegie Hall’s profitability.
Possible Approach:
This is a business turnaround and restore profitability type of case. The interview will be carried out like an interactive conversation in which the interviewer will answer your queries, ask you some questions, and provide guidance as you solve the problem.
Most case interviews proceed similarly. Your interviewer first sets up the problem. Sometimes, the interviewer will introduce the problem specifically and narrowly, so that your task is clear. Other times, the case will be more open ended, and it will be up to you to introduce greater structure.
From there, you should follow four basic steps: clarify, structure, analyze, and conclude. Let’s look at each step in detail.
Step 1: Clarify the problem. Take a few minutes at first to ask some clarifying questions or restate the problem in your own words to make sure that you understand it well. When you are clear about what you are being asked to do, move on.
Step 2: Structure the problem. Perhaps the most important step is structuring the problem. Think about what the major components of the analysis should be. For instance, if the question asks about profitability, the major components would be revenues and costs. Alternatively, think about the series of questions that you have to answer in order to make a recommendation. For example, if the case is about entering a new market, some of the questions that you would have to answer to make that decision include what the company’s capabilities are, how lucrative the market is, and what the competitive landscape is like. In any event, the idea is to organize your thoughts—then you can dive in and analyze each major category.
Step 3: Analyze the problem. As you conduct your analysis, keep in mind whether the information you are receiving and the conclusions that you are drawing really answer the question. Try to think about what information you will need and ask your interviewer questions to get that information. If you are trying to increase profitability and have found out that to do so, you must increase the quantity of goods sold, brainstorm ways that you can do this, and run your ideas by your interviewer.
Step 4: State your conclusion. Finally, at the end of the interview, take a minute to summarize the analysis you have conducted and the conclusions that you have drawn.

estimate/guesstimate,Parthenon Group,Airlines,"Case Interview Question #00186: How many pieces of luggage do you think are unloaded at Chicago Midway Airport (IATA: MDW) each day?
Possible Approach:
In this type of estimate/guesstimate case, the interviewee’s job is to work through a series of assumptions to produce a numerical answer to the question. As the interview proceeds on, you will need to interact with the interviewer, obtain information, and check your thinking. Explain your logic at each stage of the problem, and ask the interviewer whether your assumptions are correct. In all likelihood, your interviewer won’t provide you with the hard numbers you need for intermediate steps; instead, the case asks you to make reasonable assumptions and devise them yourself.
As you work through the problem, think carefully about what assumptions you are making and the ways in which they could be wrong. It doesn’t matter if your answer is right, as long as you have thought about it logically and recognized the parts of your solution that you could change to generate the correct answer.

The Anaheim city government is selling the land next door of Disneyland. Your client is unsure whether they should buy it or not. What would you advise them to make the right move?
Additional Information: (to be given to you if asked)
This is an investment decision and business expansion/adding capacity case question. A good framework to crack the case is the 3C with Revenue minus Costs in it.
I discussed various uses of the land, but the interviewer led me to the question of building a second theme park. Some of the useful data she gave me: 
Competitor: There is one other large theme park in the area (Universal Studios Hollywood) focusing on teenagers and rides. Our client’s theme park focuses on families, with the idea of creating a place where adults and their children could go and have fun together. Client also competes with other leisure activities, such as large shopping malls, zoos, video game arcades, etc.
Customer: Visitors to Disneyland Park are segmented into two groups: 30% are from local Los Angeles metropolitan area, 70% are from the rest of the country. National market has small growth, local market has solid growth.
Company: Current theme park has 80% utilization. Disney Company also owns nearby hotels and resorts to get extra revenue, at 70% utilization.
Costs: Fixed Costs have two parts. The land costs 200 million. To build up the area would cost another 600 million. Variable cost per customer is currently $25.  After the expansion, it would be $40.  
Revenues: Current average revenue per customer is $55.  We need to realize that the new theme park may cannibalize or may add value to current theme park through price. It turns out that with park addition, average revenue would be increased to $60, including: Average ticket price 35$; Average concession 15$; Merchandise average 10$.
Other key information gleaned during interview: Six months out of the year, the current theme park sells out. With additional capacity, the park could raise attendance by 30% during this period. There are 12 million total visitors during the year, 8 million during the six months peak season.

You have been hired because the processing division wants to improve its cost-to-revenue ratio (CRR). Present calculations reveal that the current CRR is 0.60. The client wants to improve this to the industry standard of 0.40. What strategies can the client pursue to lower its CRR to 0.40?

Additional Information: (to be given to you if asked)
The processing division of BEA provides back-office services for the bank’s three other divisions: Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, and Regional Banking. These services include: credit processing, payments processing, customer service processing, call center services, and credit card processing.
The client receives $100M in annual revenues. In the past, revenues have always grown or diminished in accordance with industry trends; costs increase and decrease in proportion to revenue. This trend is expected to continue in the future. An analysis of the revenue/cost distribution will show that revenue and costs are distributed evenly among the three customers. [The candidate can calculate that costs are approximately $60M.]
The client is organized into three highly independent groups, with each group servicing one customer. Analyzing the individual groups will reveal that none of them stand out as being particularly inefficient, and they all have CRR’s of about 0.60. However, there are many similarities and overlaps in the processes they perform (all processes are handled internally). [There is no need for the candidate to explore the specific processes or overlaps.]
A cost analysis will reveal two types of costs: labor and systems. Labor costs stem from the organization’s workforce of 1,000 employees, with an average annual salary of $40,000 to $45,000—salaries are in accordance with industry standards. [Salary cuts are not advisable.] Systems costs are primarily IT related, and comprise the remainder of costs.
A study of the client’s IT systems will reveal that they are below industry level in sophistication.
A competitive analysis will reveal that the average industry cost distribution is 60% labor, 40% systems. No other information is available about competition.
The client has no control over the volume of revenue it receives from its three internal customers. Furthermore, the client believes that strategies to boost revenue by fine-tuning the operations of its customers are beyond the scope of the engagement.
The client’s pricing for its internal customers is consistent with the industry standard. The client is aware that it can increase revenues by increasing internal pricing, but would like to hear other recommendations.

You have been hired by the New York City Government because they want to analyze how the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks affected the healthcare industry in New York City and what losses resulted from the 9/11 attacks?

Additional Information:
Healthcare sector economic conditions prior to 9/11
New York City’s healthcare sector, which comprises hospitals, health insurers, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and a range of smaller businesses, such as home nursing care providers and private physicians, represents approximately 20% of Gross City Product (GCP) and is the source of approximately 345,000 jobs. The city boasts the nation’s largest  concentration of world class research institutions and teaching hospitals that attract top researchers, physicians and students, capturing a significant share of available research funding. It is also home to several leading health care insurers and global pharmaceutical leaders, such as Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb. New York City also has a small but growing presence in commercial biotechnology.
Prior to September 11th, the economic outlook for the city’s health care sector was mixed. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies appeared to have generally strong prospects. These prospects were driven by steadily rising demand, the relatively recession-proof nature of their products and favorable demographics and keen investor interest, particularly over the possibilities for genomics.
Prospects for hospitals and insurers were less rosy. New York City’s hospitals had long been in poor financial shape, falling below the 90th percentile nationwide, according to several traditional hospital operating metrics, such as total margins and current ratios. This fact had left little room for capital improvements and investments in information technology and other efficiency-enhancing measures. Though their financial position had improved, somewhat, in the past several years, most city hospitals had seen a deterioration in 2001. Deterioration had been driven by significant cuts in Medicaid and Medicare funding and increasing competitiveness in the market. The city’s teaching hospitals were also vulnerable to cuts in grants for medical education. The public hospitals, which had been in better financial shape than the teaching hospitals in recent years, continued to struggle under the burden of providing free care to patients admitted without medical insurance.
New York City’s health insurance firms were in better shape than its hospitals, but still faced challenges. The biggest were posed by the slowing economy. A recessionary environment typically translated into falling revenues from premiums, as workers lost jobs and health care coverage. Revenues were also being pressured as employers shift to cheaper, more restrictive plans in order to save money. At the same time, a slowing economy tended to prompt increased utilization of health care, as employees anticipated the loss of coverage, leading to higher medical loss ratios for insurers.

Possible Answer:
Consider the influence of the capital markets and how future spot oil prices and speculation in the market impact international oil prices. Prices in general economic terms are a function of supply and demand in the market.
Demand: Explore the factors aside from price that would effect demand such as new technology, import quotas, wars, etc. It turns out that global demand for oil is inelastic meaning that changes in prices have less of an effect on quantity demanded.  If this is the case, fluctuations in supply will have a greater impact on the price.
Supply: Examine the impact of the various regional suppliers and their cost structures (for example, high cost in the U.S., low cost in the Middle East).You need to log in to access the rest of the page.

The worldwide volume of Scotch whisky exports rose to a record 1.1 billion bottles in 2009, worth $4.9 billion. Empire Merchants was a first mover in promoting imported whisky in bars, discos and karaoke clubs, which was a fast growing business in an emerging market about 10 years ago and had experienced tremendous success – an annual growth of over 30%. The client penetrated the channel with whisky through aggressive marketing and partnering with top/key outlets in big cities, offering sponsorships on events and volume rebates in return for exclusive or preferential sales on-premise.
However, the client’s growth has slowed down in the past few years to about 10% per year and profit margin is also declining. The key task in this case is to describe and understand the reasons for the recent slow down and fall in profitability. Once that has been completed, the next objective is to explore a range of strategic options for the company to rebuild its growth platform.

new product,Deloitee Consulting,Healthcare: Hospital & Medical,"Case Interview Question #00150: Your client is Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) (abbreviated BSC), a worldwide leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices whose products are used in a range of interventional medical specialties. Recently, a surgeon who consults to Boston Scientific has developed a minimally invasive approach to hip replacement surgery — involving two 1.5-2 inch incisions to replace the hip joint instead of the standard 6-10 inch single incision.

The main advantage of the new approach is that the muscles and tendons surrounding the hip joint are avoided or separated and never fully cut through as they are in the traditional approach. Therefore, patients are in less pain from the incision and their recovery time is shorter. Rather than the standard 3-5 days in the hospital, 80% of patients go home the same day as the surgery. The major drawback of the surgery is that it requires longer time in the operating room — 3 hours versus 2 hours in the traditional approach — and so far has only been performed on younger, healthier patients with commercial insurance (versus Medicare). Also, the new procedure cannot be performed on obese patients.
The device used in the new approach is exactly the same as the device used in the traditional single-incision approach; however, the instruments are slightly different (smaller) and need to be specially manufactured by Boston Scientific. 
Boston Scientific has hired your consulting team to advise them on commercializing the new hip replacement approach. Specifically, they want to know two questions:
1. Is there an economic benefit to this new approach to hip replacement surgery?
2. If so, how can your client reap financial success from it? If not, what can they do to make it economically successful?

Pfizer recognizes that the profits it enjoys will significantly decrease as its patents expire: Pfizer faces a run of 14 patent expirations through 2014, which would add up to lost revenue of about $35 billion as those drugs give way to cheap generics.

Major product lines include personal computing devices, enterprise servers, related storage devices, as well as a diverse range of printers, scanners and other office equipment products.
In September 2001, HP announced that an agreement had been reached with Compaq Computer Corporation to merge the two companies. The merger of the two major technology companies forged a team of 140,000 employees with capabilities in 160 countries, doing business in 43 currencies and 15 languages.
Numerous HP shareholders, including Walter Hewlett, publicly opposed the deal, which resulted in an impassioned public proxy battle between those for and against the deal. Contested by key members of the board until the final hours of the transaction, the merger had a media “fishbowl” effect. In addition, myriad rumors regarding layoffs heightened internal anxiety. Your client needed to quickly formulate a strategy to deal with the rumors, stabilize the workforce, and set the
strategic agenda for change.

Avon Products has markets in over 140 countries across the world. In 2007, the company’s global sales revenue amounted to US$ 9.9 billion. Sales revenue and operating income decreased significantly in comparison to year 2006 (sales revenue: -12%, operating income -10%).
The greatest part of the sales revenue (85%) was generated in four regional markets (Brazil, Great Britain, France, and Germany). In particular, the highly active sales market of Great Britain suffered a dramatic decline (sales revenue: -20%). At the same time, some competitors (Amway, Vorwerk, Mary Kay Inc., etc.) had great success with new distribution channels and, accordingly, gained additional market share.
Avon’s product range has not changed for years and is distributed through sales representatives who organize home parties in their neighborhoods. Most of the sales representatives have been with the company for a long time. Representatives get a fixed salary with a small commission; they are complaining about steadily decreasing sales figures. The number of new customers remains constantly low. In all countries, Avon has established small, but complete, business units. All business functions are decentralized (Administration, IT, Finance/Accounting, etc.). As a consequence, the London headquarters lacks understanding of the decentralized strategies followed by the individual country units.

As you leave the meeting room, you begin to realize the enormous task to which you’ve committed yourself.
Question #1. How do you evaluate the consulting environment and determine likely future scenarios?
Question #2. What information do you use in this process? How is this information obtained?
Question #3. What do you believe is most likely to happen in the consulting industry given your present knowledge? How did you arrive at this conclusion?
Question #4. What strategy do you propose to the management committee?
Possible Solutions:
This is one of the most difficult types of cases because the answers are completely unknown and will vary substantially depending upon the interviewee’s knowledge of the industry. This is also an interesting case since the salience is likely to be high. As an interviewer you should feel free to add information on an as needed basis. When information isn’t available, ask the Interviewee to develop his or her own hypotheses. What matters here is the thinking process, not necessarily the answer.

The company raises 14 million hogs a year and processes 27 million. The company produced 5.9 billion pounds of pork and 1.4 billion pounds of fresh beef in 2006.
Smithfield started as Smithfield Packing Company, now its largest subsidiary, and grew by acquiring companies such as Farmland Foods, Eckrich, and Premium Standard Farms.

Smithfield Foods owns a meat packing plant in Spain. Over the last few years profits have steadily declined, despite the fact that sales are growing. You have been hired to figure out why. How would you approach this case?
Possible Approach:
From a profitability point of view, profits = revenues – costs  = (price x sales volume) – costs. Given the fact that sales are growing but profits are declining, one can immediately identify the problem is due to either one of the following two:
1. rising costs.
2. decreased price.

industry analysis | business competition,A.T. Kearney,Airlines,"Case Interview Questions #00053: The airline industry is characterized by low returns and stiff competition. In the early years after deregulation, discount carriers like PeopleExpress Airlines sprang up. Years later the discounters have gone out of business. In a price competitive industry, why is it that the higher cost carriers were able to survive and the low cost ones like PeopleExpress Airlines were not?
Additional Background Information:
PeopleExpress Airlines (PEx) was launched in early 1981 with service from Newark to Buffalo, Columbus, and Norfolk of Virginia. People Express grew rapidly, adding flights to Florida by the end of the year.
In May 1983, PeopleExpress began non-stop service from Newark to London’s Gatwick Airport with a leased Boeing 747. Flights were initially priced at $149 each way. The airline became an instant success with all flights sold-out for several months within 24 hours of being offered. Later, the airline added Montreal-Mirabel and Brussels to its international network.
PeopleExpress airlines used a simplified fare structure whereby all seats on a given route were offered at the same price, with slight differences between “Peak” and “Off-Peak” fares. All seats were in economy class, with the exception of “Premium Class” seating on overseas flights. Fares were paid in cash aboard the aircraft early in the flight. Passengers were permitted to bring one carry-on bag for free, while each checked bag was charged a fee of $3.00. People Express was the first United States airline to charge a fee for each checked bag. People Express also charged modest amounts for customers wishing food or beverages.
In 1985, PeopleExpress bought out Denver-based Frontier Airlines. The combined company became the United States’ fifth largest airline, with flights to most major U.S. cities, as well as an additional transatlantic route to Brussels. During this period, People Express also purchased midwest commuter carrier Britt Airways and Provincetown-Boston Airlines (PBA), a regional airline with route networks in New England and Florida.
The aggressive purchasing spree placed an enormous debt burden on the carrier at the same time major legacy carriers’ improved yield management schemes enabled them to compete better with PeopleExpress on fares. Furthermore, integrating Frontier’s operations caused labor struggles with the newly absorbed airline, and the change to a low-fare, no-frills mentality alienated Frontier’s passengers.
Debt pressure on the carrier forced a change in philosophy, as PeopleExpress sought to lure business travellers who were willing to pay higher fares. Aircraft cabins were redesigned to include a first-class cabin, a frequent flyer plan was initiated, and the simplified fare structure was abandoned in favor of a more traditional airline industry “revenue management” pricing scheme.
The failed integration and enormous debt stretched People Express too far. In June 1986, the company announced it was working with an investment bank to seek buyers for part, or all, of the airline. A deal to sell Frontier off to United Airlines fell through due to the inability of United to agree to terms with its unions on how to incorporate Frontier’s staff, leading PeopleExpress management to cease Frontier’s operations and file the subsidiary for bankruptcy protection.
In the end, PeopleExpress was forced to sell itself entirely to Texas Air Corporation for roughly $125 million in cash, notes, and assumed debt. Due to concerns about regulatory approval for the purchase, Texas Air purchased the assets of Frontier from People Express in a separate transaction worth $176 million. People Express ceased to exist as a carrier on February 1, 1987, when its operations were merged into the operations of Continental Airlines, another Texas Air subsidiary, under a joint marketing agreement.

operations strategy | business turnaround,PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC),Banking,"Case Interview Questions #00050: Mr. Check is the Director of Retail Lock Box Services for Bank One, a medium sized Midwestern bank. The Retail Lock Box Department consists of 100 clerks and 8 managers and supervisors. Each year, in addition to their handling of retail lock box transactions, the Department generated $1.5 million of fee revenue processing retail credit card and mortgage payments (“items”) for 75 commercial accounts. The bank has many other commercial accounts that use other companies of’ their item processing. In fact, the Bank recently lost the item processing business for one of its largest accounts to Visa Inc., the largest item processor in the US.
The item processing industry has undergone dramatic changes in recent years. Types of items processed include credit card, mortgage, and utility payments (checks), airline tickets, and coupons. In the past, these items were usually  processed by the issuing company (e.g., airlines would process their own tickets) or by bank item processing departments like Bank One’s. At banks, the processing of payment items was done more as a service to bank customers rather than as a profit making endeavor. Hence, it received little focus from management. Historically, processing was accomplished by verifying the correctness of incoming paperwork and manually sorting, filing, and totaling the items: only the largest banks were highly automated.
Companies specializing in item processing have emerged in the past ten years. Visa, Inc., the largest such company, is a subsidiary of a small bank in Georgia. Each year Visa processes millions of airline tickets and retail payments for hundreds of companies, most of whom are not customers of its hundreds of competitors most of whom are not, customers or its parent bank. Visa uses high speed processing equipment and is highly automated. Processing time is rapid and processing costs are low. In fact, because of this speed advantage, the parent bank is beginning to profit from the float of checks processed. Although industry wide a majority of items are still processed by the issuing company or by small processors, it is expected that large processors. Within five years, it is expected that most of the business will continue to migrate to Visa and other large processors, such as MasterCard, American Express and Discover. Within five years, it is expected that Visa and other large processors will dominate this market.
Visa had a significant cost advantage over smaller operations, such as Bank One, because of the great economies of scale they gain from processing such volumes of items. In addition, Visa benefits from a more constant workload by processing both airline tickets and retail lock box receipts: airline tickets have few peaks and valleys, whereas mortgage payments always peak early in the month with very low volumes the rest of the month. Mr. Check believes that Visa quotes prices of 20 cents per item to large prospective customers while Bank One processes items for 40 cents per item.
The President of Bank One Mr. McCoy, has asked Mr. Check to evaluate how the retail lock box service can be made profitable; the service lost $100,000 last year. Mr. Check believes that the bank must offer retail lock box services, and it must price the service to be competitive with companies such as Visa. Recognizing that outside expertise will be needed, the President has given Mr. Check a budget to be used to hire a consulting firm. Mr. Check has asked you to visit his office to discuss the proposed engagement. While walking to his office, you observe that Bank One’s retail lock box operations remains primarily a manual system, with limited use of modern, high speed equipment and methods. Once in Mr. Check’s office, you note a picture showing the Department’s staff in 1965; Mr. Check was a supervising clerks at that time.

Additional Information: (to be given to you only if asked)
The Company:
The Competition: There are three other competitors in the deli meat industry. Each of these competitors has about 20% of the market share; the client has 40% of the market share. Overall the market (generic, mid-range and premium) is growing. The competition uses the same channels to sell its products.
The Customer: Although the customer buying premium deli meats has not changed, a survey of the customers indicated a variability in the quality of the product produced by the client. Sometimes the product was better than the competition; sometimes not. This was causing customers to switch to the competition.
Production Process: The client receives chunk meat in bins which meet a certain average quality measurement. Meat is rated on a scale of 1 to 100 (100 being best). The client is in a long-term contract with a meat supplier for bins at three quality ratings: 40, 70, and 90. Individual chunks within a bin may vary from this average. The premium deli meats are made from a mix of the three bins with the majority coming from the high quality 90-rated bin. Meat in the 90-rated bin ranges from 80-95 while meat in the 70-rated bin ranges from 55-80. The variability in the quality of the premium product is being driven by the variability within a 90-rated bin.

industry analysis,Schlumberger Business Consulting (SBC),"Oil, Gas & Petroleum Industry | Transportation","Case Interview Questions #00043: Your client Shell Pipeline Company LP is a subsidiary of Shell Oil (LSE: RDSA)’s Shell Oil Products US unit. Shell Pipeline Company is one of the largest petroleum products pipeline transportation (transportation of oil & gas through a pipe) companies in the US. The company has partial ownership of 10,000 miles of pipeline and annually moves more than 2 billion gallons of oil and petroleum products across 21 states in the US.
You are hired by Shell Pipeline’s CEO to evaluate the current and future potential of the pipeline industry. The pipeline industry sprang up as transportation costs for mineral extraction and oil exploration companies began to escalate. There is currently more than 25,000 miles of pipeline throughout the U.S. What information would you want to know about the pipeline industry that could help you develop a strategy for Shell Pipeline Company?
Additional Information: (to be given to you if asked)
Industry Structure: There are many pipeline competitors.  Pipeline can be characterized as either common carrier pipelines (~70% of all pipeline miles) which are regulated by the government and proprietary pipelines (~30% of all pipeline miles) which are wholly located on the private property of a firm (e.g. a pipeline from a port station to a near-shore refinery). There are many suppliers of common carrier pipelines. The second group (proprietary) is not regulated by the government.
Products: The pipelines carry liquid and gaseous materials — crude oil, natural gas, methane gas, liquid nitrogen, refined oil products (gasoline), and chemicals.
Cost Structure: There are exceptionally high fixed costs involved in a pipeline. The variable costs are primarily the electricity to power pumping stations along the pipeline. There are different cost structures depending on the type of product being moved. Pumping crude oil along the pipeline can cost as much as $2M/month in electricity for a station. Gaseous products require considerably less energy to move.
Market Conditions: U.S. proven oil & gas reserves are diminishing and foreign imports are increasing. It is expected that for the next 5-10 years demand will be steady.

industry analysis,IBM Global Business Services,"Forestry, Paper Products","Case Interview Questions #00039: You are hired by International Forest Products Limited (Interfor for short, TSX: IFP.A), a Canadian logging company based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The company is one of the Pacific Northwest’s largest producers of wood products. Its sawmilling operations have a combined manufacturing capacity of 1.6 billion board feet of lumber with sales to North America, Asia-Pacific and Europe.
The client wants you to analyze its current operations and provide advice on future operations. The logging industry in Canada is regulated by the government. Land is leased to individual companies by the government. The company is making a lot of money and is unsure why. You have been asked to determine:
(1) Why are they making so much money? 
(2) Is it sustainable?
(3) Is it replicable?
Additional Information: (to be given to you if asked)
Products: The client company produces lumber boards of two sizes 2”x4” and 2”x8”. Lumber is a commodity product and as such the company is a price-taker in the market.
Leases: The government leases tracts of land at a annual price that is set to allow for a 12% profit margin for the entire logging industry. Thus, all tracts of land have the same lease price per acre. The leases last for 99 years and the original lessee has the right of first renewal on the lease.
Profit Structure: The profit equation for the lumber industry can be written as: Profit per cubic feet = Revenue per cubic feet – Non-land cost per cubic feet – Lease Cost per cubic feet.
Revenues: There is a revenue advantage for the company due to its product mix. Margins are higher on 2”x8” boards than on 2”x4” boards. The company’s product mix is made up of a greater percentage of 2”x8” boards than the “typical” logging company percentage.
Non-land Costs: The company has a 5% cost advantage in its ”tree-to-dock” production process. There is no significant difference between the distribution costs among the industry firms.
Production Process: The cost advantage is not generated by a better logging process (i.e. better equipment, more skilled laborers) but instead exists because of the exceptional quality of the trees on the particular piece of land that the company leases. The mineral content of the land leads to faster growth of healthier trees which improves both yield and turnover. Healthier trees are straighter and easier to cut, thus reducing costs in each phase of the logging process. These healthier, taller, straighter trees yield more 2”x8” board-feet than is typical and leads to the advantaged product mix. There are no significant economies of scale to the process.

A subsidiary company of Office Depot manufactures castors (the wheels found on the bottom of office chairs) out of a plant in West Germany and another one in East Germany. Over the past two years the company’s profits have declined by 20% while revenues have been relatively flat. You have been asked to find out what is happening and suggest a course of action to reverse these trends. How would you go about the case?
Additional Information: (to be given to you if asked)
The company operates in three divisions: 50% of sales are to hospital bed manufacturers, 25% are to mop bucket manufacturers, and 25% are to chair manufacturers. The hospital bed and mop bucket divisions are located in the West German manufacturing operation, the hospital bed division is located in the East German manufacturing operation.
Breaking out each division as a separate profit center shows that revenues are up 10% for both mop bucket and chair divisions but down 10% for the hospital bed division. Similarly, profits are down 10% for both the mop bucket and chair divisions but are down 30% for the hospital bed division.
Further investigation shows that labor is the major component of cost in manufacturing castors. In the past two years, wages in the formerly state regulated East Germany have skyrocketed. This is what is driving most of the increased costs. Similarly, the demand for hospital beds (and thus castors) in East Germany has declined as they have become more efficient at managing their health care system.

The conclusion should be that the client’s total dollar sales have actually grown over that past two years, but not kept pace with the market.
Costs: The costs for your client have changed over this period: (% of selling price)
The total sales force was cut to reduce costs, though the same number of outlets are still covered by this sales force. The changes in the marketing budget come from reduced trade promotions.

Company: The company’s selling prices are set by prevailing market prices in Portugal. Land is available to expand the current factory; there is also a suitable site near Porto, the second largest city about 200 miles to the north. Approximately 80% of the customers are within 100 miles of the current plant located in Lisbon.
Production/Distribution: Raw materials are purchased from a government-owned company, and prices are set by a yearly contract with the government. The plant is unionized, and extra shifts are not possible. The trucks are owned by the company, and transport all product directly to the customers throughout the country.

The client Ben & Jerry’s sells a complete line of products (ice cream and frozen yogurt) in major supermarket chains in the Northeast. In recent years, as Americans jump on the fitness bandwagon, frozen yogurt has begun to outsell ice cream, and currently represents 55% of product sold.
The selling price per pint is the same for frozen yogurt and ice cream. The ingredients are different, however. Ice cream uses locally available milk and cream, and flavorings such as chocolate, pecans, vanilla and coffee. The premium frozen yogurts use more exotic flavorings such as mangoes, kiwis, pineapple and raspberries. All other costs are equal for the two product lines.

While in his office, you discover that kidney dialysis (a process for removing waste and excess water from the blood, and is primarily used to provide an artificial replacement for lost kidney function in people with renal failure) is a major portion of public health care expenditures.
Question: What analytical techniques would you use to determine if kidney dialysis cost can be reduced?
Suggested Frameworks:
You can start this cost cutting case by looking at the cost half of profitability analysis (Costs = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs). Since this is a procedure, rather than a whole industry, it is mostly a variable costs, the sum of which is measured by cost per unit times the number of units. Thus, one could look at this problem by analyzing:
(1) how much it costs per kidney dialysis, and
(2) how many kidney dialysis occur in the U.S. every year.

Then, sum them up to get the final total market size. Also, remember to use round numbers to simplify your calculations.
First, estimate the number of people who chew gum: of the 300 million US population, assume 15% are between the ages of 10 and 20 (the heaviest users), for a total of 45 million.

1. Products: The split of product sold has consistently been 60% vodka / 40% rum over the past few years. The selling prices of the two lines are essentially the same. Overall sales are growing at about 3% to 5% per year, the same as the industry average for these product lines.
2. Costs: An analysis of the costs reveals the following:
3. Distribution: The products are sold throughout the United States. In 27 so-called “open” states, where alcohol is sold in privately managed supermarkets and liquor stores, shelf space is extremely expensive and trade promotions are critical. Such stores are also becoming less and less willing to hold inventory, which is increasing distribution costs by requiring more frequent deliveries. In the other 23 states, liquor is only sold through state regulated liquor stores. Distribution costs in these states is much lower, as there are far fewer outlets to service and central warehouses for the state-run stores. Advertising of alcohol is much more tightly regulated, and therefore, advertising spending is lower.

This division has sales of $600 million per year. The entire company has sales of over $20 billion. The chilled segment represents $120 million in sales per year.

What would you advise her to do? Should Naked Juice sell the chilled juices business?
Additional Information: (to be given to you only if asked)
1. Market Share: Chilled beverages is a $5 billion dollar industry nationwide. There are two large players that have 40% and 25% of the market share, respectively. Your client’s market share, 12%, makes her third in the industry.
2. Competition: The best available information indicates that the two market leaders are profitable. Also, the two market leaders are able to fund more advertising and more promotion, trade and couponing than your client.
3. Products: The two market leaders produce pure orange juice and blends that are based on citrus juices. Your client’s product uses more elaborate blends of juices, usually with a base of pear or peach juice (95% of the inputs) and flavored with cranberries, bananas, mangoes, etc. (the other 5% of the inputs).

4. Customers: The market for chilled juices is essentially mothers with school age children. This is a highly price sensitive market that loves coupons, promotions, etc.
5. Price: Brand name is important in this market, as in juice boxes and frozen concentrate, as mothers tend to prefer highly reliable products for their children. However, the brand premium must be in line with other branded products. Therefore, all branded juices tend to sell in the same price range.

However, the management feels that the Northeast is not the fastest growing area of the country, and, therefore, acquired another cable television company in Tucson, Arizona a little over a year ago. Despite every effort of management, the Tucson company’s sales have been stagnant, and the company has been losing money ever since then. How would you analyze this situation? What might be the cause of the poor performance of the Tucson cable company? What could be done to turn around the failing Tucson cable company?
Additional Information: (to be given to you if asked)
1. Customers: The Tucson area is smaller than Philadelphia, but larger than Rochester and Stamford. Tucson’s population is also growing at 12% per year on average. Per capita income is higher than in Philadelphia and the same as in Rochester and in Stamford.
2. Costs: Operating costs in Tucson are essentially the same as in the other markets.  The cost of programming is based on number of subscribers and is equal across the nation. Operating costs are composed of variable items: sales staff, maintenance, administration and marketing. Only maintenance is higher that in the other markets, due to the larger land area serviced. Fixed costs relate to the cable lines, which is a function of physical area covered.
3. Company: The Tucson cable company has attempted marketing efforts in the past, such as free Disney programming for one month, free HBO for one month, free hookup, etc. These programs have been modeled after the other three markets.
Cable penetration rates in the three Northeastern markets average 45%. The penetration rate in Tucson is only 20%. These rates have been steady over the past three years in the Northeast. The penetration rate in Tucson has only risen by 2% in the past three years in Tucson.

Ms. Pepper has just received a proposal from upper management to sell the stationery business and she wants us to help her determine if she should sell it. Or if not, what she should do to turn around the stationery business to make it profitable. What would you suggest she do?
Additional Information: (to be given to you only if asked)
1. Market Share: Stationery is a $15 billion dollar industry nationwide in the US. There are two major players that have 30% and 25% of the market share, respectively. Your client’s market share, 12%, makes her third in the industry.
2. Competitions: The best available information indicates that the two market leaders are profitable. The two market leaders are able to fund more advertising and promotions, such as coupons, than your client.
3. Company: Ms. Pepper’s division has sales of $825 million per year. The entire company has sales of over $35 billion. Stationery products represent $118 million in sales per year.
One plant in California produces all of the paper products: toilet tissue, paper plates/cups and stationery. It would be difficult to find another use for the plant without a major conversion.
4. Products: The two market leaders produce pure stationery products using only cellulose, which is derived from plant fibers. The cellulose is made by cutting down trees and then grinding up trees and dumping the wood pulp in acid.
Your client’s product uses a more elaborate process to produce recyclable stationery paper. In addition to the wood pulp in acid, the client’s product uses special fiber pellets. The wood pulp in acid is the same cost as the competitors, but the other items necessary for creating recyclable materials cost about twice as much.
Actually, the company does not have a real preference for which type of paper is produced. The recyclable goods niche was at one time perceived to be an attractive market, but the high costs of production have limited our profitability in that space.
5. Customers: The market for stationery products is essentially mothers with school age children, young adults, and college and graduate students. This is a highly price sensitive market that loves coupons, promotions, etc.
6. Price: Brand name is very important in this market, as in paper towels and paper plates/paper cups. However, this market is also very price sensitive; as you may note earlier, it is very responsive to coupons and other price promotions.
